abstract = {Nowadays, security incidents have become a familiar "nuisance, " and they regularly lead to the exposure of private and sensitive data. The root causes for such incidents are rarely complex attacks. Instead , they are enabled by simple misconfigurations, such as authen-tication not being required, or security updates not being installed. For example, the leak of over 140 million Americans' private data from Equifax's systems is among most severe misconfigurations in recent history: The underlying vulnerability was long known, and a security patch had been available for months, but was never applied. Ultimately, Equifax blamed an employee for forgetting to update the affected system, highlighting his personal responsibility. In this paper, we investigate the operators' perspective on security misconfigurations to approach the human component of this class of security issues. We focus our analysis on system operators, who have not received significant attention by prior research. Hence, we investigate their perspective with an inductive approach and apply a multi-step empirical methodology: (i) a qualitative study to understand how to approach the target group and measure the mis-configuration phenomenon, and (ii) a quantitative survey rooted in the qualitative data. We then provide the first analysis of system operators' perspective on security misconfigurations, and we determine the factors that operators perceive as the root causes. Based on our findings, we provide practical recommendations on how to reduce security misconfigurations' frequency and impact.

abstract = {This article reports on a simulated phishing experiment targeting 6,938 faculty and staff at George Mason University. The three-week phishing campaign employed three types of phishing exploits and examined demographic, linked workstation/network monitoring audit data, and a variety of behavioral and psychological factors measured via pre- and post-campaign surveys. While earlier research studies have reported disparate effects of gender and age, the present results suggest that these effects are not significant or are of limited strength and that other underlying factors may be more important. Specifically, significant differences in phishing susceptibility were obtained for different email contexts and based on whether individuals have been successfully phished before (these people were more likely to succumb to subsequent phishing emails in our study). Further, participants who responded to phishing exploits scored higher on impulsivity than the non-clickers. Also, participants whose survey responses indicated that they had more appropriate online “security hygiene habits,” such as checking the legitimacy of links, were less likely to be successfully phished in our campaign. Participants whose post-campaign survey responses indicated that they were suspicious of a phishing email message in our campaign were far less likely to click on the phishing link than those who were not suspicious. Similar results were obtained for judgments of pertinence of the email. Participants who indicated that they thought about the negative consequences of clicking the link were less likely to do so than participants who did not think about the negative consequences. Implications for effective training and awareness are discussed.},

These "community-sourced risk'' systems are designed for the safety departments to take action to prevent or reduce the severity of situations that may harm the community. However, little is known about the actual use of such community-sourced risk systems from the perspective of both community members and the safety departments. This study is the first large-scale empirical analysis of community-sourced risk systems. More specifically, we conducted a comprehensive system log analysis of LiveSafe--a community-sourced risk system--that has been used by more than two hundred universities and colleges. Our findings revealed a mismatch between what the safety departments expected to receive and what their community members actually reported, and identified several factors (e.g., anonymity, organization, and tip type) that were associated with the safety departments' responses to their members' tips. Our findings provide design implications for chatbot-enabled community-risk systems and make practical contributions for safety organizations and practitioners to improve community engagement.},

abstract = {Despite the large investments in information security technologies and research over the past decades, the information security industry is still immature when it comes to vulnerability management. In particular, the prioritization of remediation efforts within vulnerability management programs predominantly relies on a mixture of subjective expert opinion and severity scores. Compounding the need for prioritization is the increase in the number of vulnerabilities the average enterprise has to remediate. This article describes the first open, data-driven framework for assessing vulnerability threat, that is, the probability that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild within the first 12 months after public disclosure. This scoring system has been designed to be simple enough to be implemented by practitioners without specialized tools or software yet provides accurate estimates (ROC AUC = 0.838) of exploitation. Moreover, the implementation is flexible enough that it can be updated as more, and better, data becomes available. We call this system the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS).},

In the latter part of the article, we discuss the consequences of these shifts for contemporary research problems. In particular, we explore the problem of designed obsolescence, a core issue for Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) research. We show how the framing of the maker, as an empowered subject, presents certain opportunities and limitations for this research discourse. Finally, we offer alternative framings of empowerment that can expand maker discourse and its use in contemporary research problems such as SID.},

abstract = {A growing body of research suggests that intimate partner abusers use digital technologies to surveil their partners, including by installing spyware apps, compromising devices and online accounts, and employing social engineering tactics. However, to date, this form of privacy violation, called intimate partner surveillance (IPS), has primarily been studied from the perspective of victim-survivors. We present a qualitative study of how potential perpetrators of IPS harness the emotive power of sharing personal narratives to validate and legitimise their abusive behaviours. We analysed 556 stories of IPS posted on publicly accessible online forums dedicated to the discussion of sexual infidelity. We found that many users share narrative posts describing IPS as they boast about their actions, advise others on how to perform IPS without detection, and seek suggestions for next steps to take. We identify a set of common thematic story structures, justifications for abuse, and outcomes within the stories that provide a window into how these individuals believe their behaviour to be justified. Using these stories, we develop a four-stage framework that captures the change in a potential perpetrator's approach to IPS. We use our findings and framework to guide a discussion of efforts to combat abuse, including how we can identify crucial moments where interventions might be safely applied to prevent or deescalate IPS.},

In this article, we study how to tackle and measure this problem automatically. We present a pipeline with two machine learning stages that can detect the ecommerce websites present in the list of brand search results and distinguish between legitimate and fake ecommerce websites. For each classification task, we identify and extract suitable learning features and study their relative importance. Through a prototype system termed RI.SI.CO., we show that this approach is feasible, fast, and more accurate than both existing systems for trustworthiness assessment and non-expert humans. We next introduce two complementary metrics for evaluating the counterfeit incidence in brand search results: namely, a chart-based and a single-value measure. They allow us to analyze and compare counterfeit at various levels, including single brands within a specific sector as well as whole sectors. Experimenting with two luxury goods sectors, we report a number of interesting findings about how the main search parameters (e.g., search engine, query type, number of search results seen) affect counterfeiting and how this activity changes with time. On the whole, our research offers new insights and some very practical and useful means of analyzing and measuring counterfeit in brand search results, thus increasing awareness of and knowledge about this phenomenon and enabling targeted anti-counterfeiting actions.},

Therefore, maintaining data privacy in complex systems is important and necessary, particularly in organizations where the vast majority of individuals interacting with these systems is students. In most cases, students engage in data breaches and digital misconduct due to the lack of knowledge and awareness of cybersecurity and the consequences of cybercrime. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the level of cybersecurity awareness and user compliance among undergraduate students at Majmaah University using a scientific questionnaire based on several safety factors for the use of the Internet. We quantitatively evaluated the knowledge of cybercrime and protection among students to show the need for user education, training, and awareness. In this study, we used a quantitative research methodology and conducted different statistical tests, such as ANOVA, Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO), and Bartlett's tests, to evaluate and analyze the hypotheses. Safety concerns for electronic emails, computer viruses, phishing, forged ads, popup windows, and supplementary outbreaks on the Internet were well-examined in this study.

abstract = {Introduction An increasing number of ethnic minorities (EMs) have been employed in the construction industry to alleviate severe labor shortages in many countries. Unfortunately, statistics show that EMs have higher fatal and non-fatal occupational injury rates than their local counterparts. However, EMs are often underrepresented in safety climate (SC) research as they are difficult to reach and gauge their perception. A positive relationship has been widely found between SC and safety performance. Understanding the safety perceptions of EMs helps to reduce injuries and improve their safety performance. Method Based on a sample of 320 EMs from 20 companies in the construction industry, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to identify the SC factors of EMs, and validate the extracted factors, respectively. Multivariate analysis of variance was undertaken to examine mean differences in perceptions of SC by personal characteristics. Results Three SC factors for EMs encapsulating 16 variables were identified through EFA. The hypothesized CFA model for a three-factor structure derived from EFA showed a satisfactory goodness-of-fit, composite reliability, and construct validity. Conclusions Three SC factors were identified, namely: (a) safety management commitment, safety resources, and safety communication; (b) employee's involvement and workmate's influence; and (c) perception of safety rules, procedures and risks. The perceptions of SC differed significantly by nationality, marital status, the number of family members supported, and drinking habit. Practical applications This study reveals the perception of EMs toward SC. The findings highlight the areas for safety improvement and provide leading indicators for safety performance of EMs. The findings are also enlightening for countries with a number of EMs, such as the United Sates, the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, and the Middle East. {\textcopyright} 2017},

The 2014 NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides businesses with an organizational tool to catalog cybersecurity efforts and areas that need additional support. As part of an on-going effort to develop a holistic, predictive cyber security risk assessment model, the characterization of human factors, which includes human behavior, is needed to understand how the actions of users, defenders (IT personnel), and attackers affect cybersecurity risk. Trust has been found to be a crucial element affecting an individual's role within a cyber system. The use of trust as a human factor in holistic cybersecurity risk assessment relies on an understanding how differing mental models, risk postures, and social biases impact the level trust given to an individual and the biases affecting the ability to give said trust. The Human Factors Ontology illustrates the individual characteristics, situational characteristics, and relationships that influence the trust given to an individual. Furthering the incorporation of ontologies into the science of cybersecurity will help decision-makers build the foundation needed for predictive and quantitative risk assessments.},

The aim of this study was to model and work on human factors elements affecting safety performance of control room operators in the oil industry in Iran using a hybrid intelligent approach. Safety performance among control room operators regarding human factors issues was considered in the field and a hybrid intelligent model was employed to model the obtained data. The valid questionnaire containing 283 items in 28 dimensions was used to evaluate safety performance. A hybrid intelligent model in three stages was used to estimate safety performance among control room operators. In the first stage, principal components analysis (PCA) was used to extract 28 main dimensions from related items in the questionnaire. In the second stage, correlation-based feature selection (CFS) was applied to identify the most important dimensions (features) affecting safety performance. In the third stage, genetic fuzzy system was employed for modeling safety performance by selected dimensions as input variables. The feature selection method showed that human-computer interface, manual materials handling, safety culture, safe work practices and permit–to–work systems, quantitative risk analysis, competence management, and incident investigation were the subsets with the highest merit values. The results of genetic fuzzy system revealed that, among features with the highest merit values, safe work practices and permit–to–work systems, human-computer interface, and staff competence had major effects on safety performance of control room operators. {\textcopyright} 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

abstract = {Understanding a crew's response to a rapid decompression, and factors which can influence the decisions crew members make, can facilitate a safe resolution of a potentially life threatening hazard. Anticipating the Human Factors issues is an appropriate way to assess potential risk factors before such an event happens. The Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) and its predictive risk assessment method, System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA), is a systemic approach to safety analysis. This approach is ideal when considering complex systems, such as aviation. The scenario of an aircraft experiencing a decompression event was analysed using STAMP-STPA across a series of workshops during which key safety elements were identified and reflected upon. It was found that the use of the STAMP-STPA methodology successfully identified factors central to the Helios 522 accident. Based on the outputs of this research, it is suggested that, due to its inherent utility, the STAMP-STPA method can be used to elicit a variety of safety critical insights, and does so in a way that considers individuals, organisations and technology at the same level of granularity, in a way that does not attribute blame to any single agent. {\textcopyright} 2017},

This paper presents the key success factors supporting good HFI within UK Defence and how Corporate Risk Associates (CRA) have applied these lessons across other high-risk industries. Through experience, CRA have repeatedly found specific HFI activities to be directly linked to the success factors of a range of projects in terms of meeting requirements, effective identification and prioritisation of human related risks and issues, and stakeholder and end user buy in. These factors address the issues and barriers to effective HFI which include effective base lining, early engagement of Human Factors (HF) expertise and risk analysis. � 2018 American Nuclear Society - International Topical Meeting on Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Analysis, PSA 2007.

abstract = {According to the findings of the United States District Court on the BP Deepwater Horizon case, “the misinterpretation of the negative pressure test was a substantial cause of the blowout, explosion, fire, and oil spill”. This point of view is corroborated by several credible investigation reports on this accident as well. It is also noteworthy that the negative pressure test (NPT) was not only specific to the Macondo well operations, rather it is a critical procedure to ascertain well integrity in offshore drilling in general. Therefore, the correct implementation and interpretation of this test is crucial for the safety of future offshore drilling. This study adopts the AcciMap model, which was originally proposed by Rasmussen (1997), for the risk assessment of the NPT misinterpretation by incorporating associated socio-technical and human factors into an integrated framework. This graphical framework analyzes the main contributing causes of that misinterpretation and the interactions between different involved key decision-makers from all system levels. In general, analysis of past accidents within the stated framework can define patterns of hazards within an industrial sector. Such analysis can lead to the definition of preconditions for safe operations, which is a main focus of proactive risk management systems. {\textcopyright} 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

The paper examines the role of the human factor in ensuring the safety of energy objects following the introduction of intellectual power systems. To assess and improve the reliability of an employee, the authors suggest using a safety profile, which includes such characteristics as the knowledge and understanding of safety rules and procedures, adherence to the culture of safety, professional expertise, moral and psychological stability, absence of addictions or high vulnerability to external environment.

abstract = {In future work systems, humans may interact with scalable industrial robots. In a virtual reality simulation study, human mental workload effects were analyzed in human-robot interactions (HRI) with variations in design requirements regarding human factors and ergonomics (HFE) as well as occupational safety and health (OSH). Each of 20 participants performed his/her own task while interacting with two virtual robots in a manufacturing environment. Results on task performance indicated relative lower human mental workload when robots acted on lower level of robot autonomy (lower LORA) and the human operator was informed about upcoming HRI by multi-modal signaling (Information Aid ‘on'). However, this pattern of workload reflected in performance measures, was not reflected in mental workload ratings. Hence, compensational adjustments in operator performance were assumed. It was concluded, that a combination of less autonomous robots and multi-modal feedback result in relatively less operator distraction from task performance and, thus, less impairment in operator workload. HFE and OSH may improve when HRI is audio-visually indicated and robot activities are adapted to human operator task requirements (low LORA). Therefore, results have the potential to inform future design of HRI regarding HFE and OSH at different workplaces in industry and services. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {We describe a qualitative study conducted using Contextual Inquiry of 60 low-literate users in India. For the purpose of this study, we define low-literate as those users whose education is equal or more than Standard Four and less than or equal to Standard Eight in the Indian State education system. Our users were recruited primarily from the contractual housekeeping staff of a very large Private Organization and an Educational Institute (42 M ale, 3 Female), household help (3 Female), drivers (5 M ale), guards (1 M ale), shopkeepers (1 M ale, 1 Female) and homemakers (4 Female). Our objective was to develop an understanding of information security issues in the context of the mobile phone, identification of problems and design ideas for design of interventions. Our methodology included Contextual Inquiry and Analysis with notes pertaining to User Statements, Task Breakdowns, Observations and Design Ideas. The notes across the study were consolidated using Affinity Diagrams. We found that users have an elementary understanding of asset valuation and response. Literacy impedes adoption of an appropriate response to the threats using the mechanisms provided by the mobile phone since conceptual models are not clearly comprehended. It is also impeded because the users are unable to articulate a structured response to the landscape of threats. Due to the cognitive load induced by the possible factors which may get involved in risk articulation, users tend to adopt mitigation techniques propagated by the micro-networks without complete comprehension of risks or due analysis. Belief systems are more likely to drive a response than a more reasoned, well-aware response. Information or awareness is propagated via social mechanisms-however, these are not necessarily correct most of the times, primarily due to the inappropriate conceptual models formulated. The interface and conceptual model complexity of a modern touch screen smartphone compounds matters. Mobile Learning aids or Gamification of concepts can help users adopt more appropriate response mechanism to perceived threats to privacy and security issues. Interfaces built with single sign-on, local language display and text input would also help in building more safe environments for users to use the mobile phone. While more-literate users are likely to mimic a ‗plan-do-check-act' model low-literate are more likely to have a ‗do' or a ‗do' or a ‗do-act' cycle due to non-awareness or non-comprehension of ‗plan-check' components.

abstract = {Until research addressing control room performance in the presence of cyber events is more fully performed, and the nature of human performance requirements better characterized, the validity of contemporary HRA methods in assessing cyber event response is, at best, limited and strained. This is not surprising because many of the existing HRA methods were designed with a world in mind where event sequences and timing were accounted for in the PRA analysis, and equipment and displays, except when unavailable, were expected to work as designed. This is not the case in complex automation events or cyber events. As a result, we have to develop a robust HRA framework for cyber events that can encompass the types of human and technology failure modes associated with cyber events. We need to identify whether the performance shaping factors used in most current methods are the correct ones. Rather than delete PSFs from older HRA methods, this paper suggests 6 additional PSFs that should be considered for cyber HRA: clumsy or inadequate function allocation; lack of automation transparency; lack of cyber experience, and conflicting goals of asset protection, and worker safety; presence of conflicting information; and actions of the automation no longer predictable. Alas, many attack consequences are hard to pre-empt or predict; connectivity is not apparent, and system dependencies are unknown; and from the operator perspective, the data most needed by the operator to make a decision may be difficult to retrieve. In order to perform a proper HRA, we need to understand what operator performance requirements are to be expected during these events, and whether cues critical to task performance are likely to be present. The HRA method does not need to be full of cyber jargon; however, the analyst needs to understand how the interaction of IT with industrial control systems networks, if compromised, can lead to increased human failure events and plant risk. Finally, the application of HRA as part of a risk-based approach will identify more than just the need for better or more appropriate human machine interface or procedures, it will allow asset owners to identify the need for and put into place, the policies, controls and engineered safety features that can reduce public risk.},

abstract = {Conventional patterns of the ways information systems run are rapidly evolving. Cloud computing undisputedly has influenced profoundly in this direction by providing many benefits such as accessibility and availability of resources to organisations. But the economical advantage and the cost impacts are far more attractive to organisations than anything else when it comes to cloud computing. This convenient and attractiveness comes with new phases of security and risk challenges for both cloud providers and clients which requires investment for managing and mitigating them. The challenges get more complicated as the service itself passes geographical and national boundaries which create a completely new paradigm for security, risk, privacy, and more importantly cost implications. Social Engineering Attacks (SEAs) are example of those risks that are very attractive way for attackers for accessing classified data. There are certain constraints for employees when they use LAN. These limitations reduced greatly by the introduction of Cloud and off-site services. This allows attackers to use any compromised passwords from any web-connected device. This paper discusses main issues in migrating to a cloud environment by organisations regarding the human factors of SEAs threats and risks related concepts. The approach provides a set of recommendations for appropriate control actions to mitigate related risks. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {Contract systems, especially of the higher-order flavor, go hand in hand with blame. The pragmatic purpose of blame is to narrow down the code that a programmer needs to examine to locate the bug when the contract system discovers a contract violation. Or so the literature on higher-order contracts claims. In reality, however, there is neither empirical nor theoretical evidence that connects blame with the location of bugs. The reputation of blame as a tool for weeding out bugs rests on anecdotes about how programmers use contracts to shift blame and their attention from one part of a program to another until they discover the source of the problem. This paper aims to fill the apparent gap and shed light to the relation between blame and bugs. To that end, we introduce an empirical methodology for investigating whether, for a given contract system, it is possible to translate blame information to the location of bugs in a systematic manner. Our methodology is inspired by how programmers attempt to increase the precision of the contracts of a blamed component in order to shift blame to another component, which becomes the next candidate for containing the bug. In particular, we construct a framework that enables us to ask for a contract system whether (i) the process of blame shifting causes blame to eventually settle to the component that contains the bug; and (ii) every shift moves blame "closer" to the faulty component. Our methodology offers a rigorous means for evaluating the pragmatics of contract systems, and we employ it to analyze Racket's contract system. Along the way, we uncover subtle points about the pragmatic meaning of contracts and blame in Racket: (i) the expressiveness of Racket's off-the-shelf contract language is not sufficient to narrow down the blamed portion of the code to the faulty component in all cases; and (ii) contracts that trigger state changes (even unexpectedly, perhaps in the runtime system's data structures or caches) interfere with program evaluation in subtle ways and thus blame shifting can lead programmers on a detour when searching for a bug. These points highlight how evaluations such as ours suggest fixes to language design.},

First, the paper constructs the risk assessment index system, which consists of 28 risk factors involved four types of personnel, equipment, environment, and management. Second, the risk factors are sorted by Borda value method, and the key risk factors are found out according to the Borda sequence value, which can help managers to take targeted measures. Finally, the model is employed in the safety assessment of heavy-haul transport of Datong–Baotou railway. The results show that its safety risk grade is in secondary grade. The top three risk factors are the reliability of power system, the damage of water disaster and the rescue equipment. And the result is consistent with the actual.

abstract = {Purpose: Human group behavior is the driving force behind many complex social and economic phenomena. Few studies have integrated multi-dimensional travel patterns and city interest points to construct urban security risk indicators. This paper combines traffic data and urban alarm data to analyze the safe travel characteristics of the urban population. The research results are helpful to explore the diversity of human group behavior, grasp the temporal and spatial laws and reveal regional security risks. It provides a reference for optimizing resource deployment and group intelligence analysis in emergency management. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the dynamics index of group behavior, this paper mines the data of large shared bikes and ride-hailing in a big city of China. We integrate the urban interest points and travel dynamic characteristics, construct the urban traffic safety index based on alarm behavior and further calculate the urban safety index. Findings: This study found significant differences in the travel power index among ride-sharing users. There is a positive correlation between user shared bike trips and the power-law bimodal phenomenon in the logarithmic coordinate system. It is closely related to the urban public security index. Originality/value: Based on group-shared dynamic index integrated alarm, we innovatively constructed an urban public safety index and analyzed the correlation of travel alarm behavior. The research results fully reveal the internal mechanism of the group behavior safety index and provide a valuable supplement for the police intelligence analysis. {\textcopyright} 2022, XiYue Deng, Xiaoming Li, Zhenzhen Chen, Mengli Zhu, Naixue Xiong and Li Shen.},

abstract = {Managers rarely have deep knowledge of cyber security, and yet are expected to make decisions with cyber security implications for software-based systems. We investigate the decision-making conversations of 7 teams of senior managers from the same organisation, as they complete the Decisions&Disruptions (D-D) cyber security exercise. We use Grounded Theory to situate our analysis of their decision-making and help us explore how these complex socio-cognitive interactions occur. We have developed a goal-model (using iStar 2.0) of the teams' dialogue which illustrates what cyber security goals teams identify and how they operationalise their decisions to reach these goals. We complement this with our model of cyber security reasoning which describes how these teams make their decisions, showing how each team members' experience, intuition and understanding affects the team's overall shared reasoning and decision-making. Our findings show how managers with little cyber security expertise are able to use logic and traditional risk management thinking to make cyber security decisions. Despite their lack of cyber security specific training they demonstrate reasoning which closely resembles the decision-making approaches espoused in cyber security specific standards (e.g., NIST/ISO). Our work demonstrates how organisations and practitioners can enrich goal modelling to capture not only what security goals an organisation has (and how they can operationalise them) but also how and why these goals have been identified. Ultimately, non-cyber security experts can develop their cyber security model based on their current context (and update it when new requirements appear or new incidents happen), whilst capturing their reasoning at every stage. },

abstract = {The intrinsic level of coal mine safety is directly related to its connatural risks, namely the hazard factors. However, the offset risk factors, namely the safety control capability, ultimately determine the desirable operating level. In this paper, the offset risk factors were studied from the aspects of personnel, material (machine), environment and management to control coal mine safety in contrast to describing system risk. The model was constructed and described using safety entropy and cask theory by fully understanding the hazard factors and offset risk factors. Then a set of model evaluation indexes were derived based on the above analysis. A back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was developed to evaluate the safety control capability. It was trained and tested with data collected from forty-one state-owned coal mines in China; thirty-six were used to train the network and the rest were used to test it. The results showed that simulation performance was acceptable and the goodness of fit was high. The weights of personnel, material (machine), environment and management on the safety control capability are 0.26, 0.29, 0.22 and 0.23 respectively. Finally, the trained network was applied to assess the Wulanmulun mine's safety control capability. The results indicated a high level of safety control capability (0.93). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {How well can people estimate IT-related risk? Although estimating risk is a fundamental activity in software management and risk is the basis for many decisions, little is known about how well IT-related risk can be estimated at all. Therefore, we executed a risk estimation experiment with 36 participants. They estimated the probabilities of IT-related risks and we investigated the effect of the following factors on the quality of the risk estimation: the estimator's age, work experience in computing, (self-reported) safety awareness and previous experience with this risk, the absolute value of the risk's probability, and the effect of knowing the estimates of the other participants (see: Delphi method). Our main findings are: risk probabilities are difficult to estimate. Younger and inexperienced estimators were not significantly worse than older and more experienced estimators, but the older and more experienced subjects better used the knowledge gained by knowing the other estimators' results. Persons with higher safety awareness tend to overestimate risk probabilities, but can better estimate ordinal ranks of risk probabilities. Previous own experience with a risk leads to an overestimation of its probability (unlike in other fields like medicine or disasters, where experience with a disease leads to more realistic probability estimates and nonexperience to an underestimation). {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a disruptive technology intended to implement secure decentralised distributed systems, in which transactional data can be shared, stored, and verified by participants of the system without needing a central authentication/verification authority. Blockchain-based systems have several architectural components and variants, which architects can leverage to build secure software systems. However, there is a lack of studies to assist architects in making architecture design and configuration decisions for blockchain-based systems. This knowledge gap may increase the chance of making unsuitable design decisions and producing configurations prone to potential security risks. To address this limitation, we report our comprehensive systematic literature review to derive a taxonomy of commonly used architecture design decisions in blockchain-based systems. We map each of these decisions to potential security attacks and their posed threats. MITRE's attack tactic categories and Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling are used to systematically classify threats and their associated attacks to identify potential attacks and threats in blockchain-based systems. Our mapping approach aims to guide architects to make justifiable design decisions that will result in more secure implementations.},

abstract = {Innovation is a very important concern for both managers and governmental policy makers. There is an important interplay between security and technology innovation that is largely unrecognized in the literature. This research considers the case where technology innovation in the form of additional product features increases demand through greater functionality. However, the likelihood of a security breach increases with the number of product features as the features interact in unintended ways, thereby increasing the attack surface. Using a two-stage game, we demonstrate how potential demand changes (from direct risk or externalities) impact firm technology innovation strategy. The analysis shows that the type and extent of customer demand reaction has a significant impact on innovative feature development. This research identifies two potential impacts on the level of innovation that can be strategically managed - the impact of externalities on demand and industry risk - explaining how these forces alter the level of innovation in the product ecosystem. Additionally, high-security development is disincentivized, and leads to a type of competitive behavior where the opportunity window for high-security development for all firms is small.},

Two crucial aspects have to be taken into account modelling man-machine interaction in Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA): 1. The need to include the human interaction in the logical model of QRAs techniques; 2. The quantification of the effect of human factors. The efforts were thus aimed at defining an improved methodological framework encompassing the integration of Human and Organisational Factors (H&OF) into safety analysis by means of quantitative risk assessment schemes. In the end, the Integrated Dynamic Decision Analysis (IDDA) was adopted, integrated to Task Analysis. This tool allows modelling the logic of a complex system; it provides a representation of all the possible alternative states into which the system could evolve as a real logical and temporal sequence of events. The proposed model is designed with the aim of transferring the IDDA philosophy to the in-depth study of the deviations that may occur during human implementation of operational procedures and to analyse their effects on system reliability. {\textcopyright} RAMS Consultants Printed in India.},

In this article, we first define the notion of user intent and construct a model for a common scenario that poses a very high risk for sensitive data stored in the organization's database. We show that the complexity of identifying pseudo-intents of a user in this scenario is coNP-Complete, and launching a harvester insider attack within the boundaries of the defined threat model takes linear time while a targeted threat model is an NP-Complete problem. We also discuss the general defense mechanisms against the modeled threats and show that countering the harvester insider attack takes quadratic time while countering the targeted insider attack can take linear to quadratic time, depending on the strategy chosen. We analyze the adversarial behavior and show that launching an attack with minimum risk is also an NP-Complete problem. Finally, we perform timing experiments with the defense mechanisms on SQL query workloads collected from a national bank to test the feasibility of using these systems in real time.},

abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in addressing risk analysis. We propose an influence diagram-based approach that focuses on a Benefit, Cost, Deficit (BCD) model. The BCD model is proposed for studying the intentional deviant behaviors of human operators in a system. In this model, the consequences of human actions are analyzed with respect to three parameters: benefit, cost and deficit. Our approach aims to expand the BCD model by integrating factors, such as those related to the organization of the system in question, that influence human operator actions. In addition, the approach considers multiple criteria that are related, for example, to safety and productivity. To build a model that evaluates the risk induced by human actions in a system and analyzes the impact of the different factors, we use influence diagrams. Influence diagrams are probabilistic graphical models that can deal with uncertainty and with incomplete and imprecise information. Influence diagrams also represent the interdependencies between the different variables of the studied problem. In addition, contrary to Bayesian networks, influence diagrams can rank a set of actions by providing information on which action carries the greatest risk or the most benefits. We applied this approach to a case study of an industrial rotary press, but it can also be used in other problems and sectors. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many safety-related systems are evolving into cyber-physical systems (CPSs), integrating information technologies in their control architectures and modifying the interactions among automation and human operators. Particularly, a promising potential exists for enhanced efficiency and safety in applications such as autonomous transportation systems, control systems in critical infrastructures, smart manufacturing and process plants, robotics, and smart medical devices, among others. However, the modern features of CPSs are ambiguous for system designers and risk analysts, especially considering the role of humans and the interactions between safety and security. The sources of safety risks are not restricted to accidental failures and errors anymore. Indeed, cybersecurity attacks can now cascade into safety risks leading to physical harm to the system and its environment. These new challenges demand system engineers and risk analysts to understand the security vulnerabilities existing in CPS features and their dependencies with physical processes. Therefore, this paper (a) examines the key features of CPSs and their relation with other system types; (b) defines the dependencies between levels of automation and human roles in CPSs from a systems engineering perspective; and (c) applies systems thinking to describe a multi-layered diagrammatic representation of CPSs for combined safety and security risk analysis, demonstrating an application in the maritime sector to analyze an autonomous surface vehicle. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

abstract = {Recent maritime cybersecurity accidents reveal that shipping is facing increased exposure to cyber threats, especially due to the fast-growing digitalisation of the sector, leaving vessels and their onboard systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This research aims at evaluating the relationship among the critical dimensions influencing cybersecurity performance in the maritime industry. To achieve this, six critical dimensions related to cybersecurity preparedness are first identified through literature review, namely ‘regulations', ‘company procedures' from a managerial perspective and ‘shipboard systems readiness', ‘training and awareness', ‘human factor' and ‘compliance monitoring' at an operation level. A Likert-scale questionnaire is designed and used to collect empirical data from 133 seafarers and shore-based staff. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is applied to examine the causal relationships between the six dimensions and shipboard cybersecurity performance. The results show that ‘regulations' positively influence shipping companies' cybersecurity-related ‘procedures', which in turn positively affects ‘shipboard systems readiness', ‘training and awareness', and ‘monitoring'. Further, ‘training and awareness' positively influences the cybersecurity performance of ships. The results have profound implications for the shipping industry on how to strengthen their cyber practices in order to improve their cybersecurity performance. Recommendations for future academic research related to maritime cybersecurity are also provided. {\textcopyright} 2022 The Author(s).

abstract = {The hazard perception of construction workers plays a predominant role in their behavioral decision-making process under risk environment. However, the evolution mechanisms of hazard perception are still unclear, not only because it is hard to observe and measure, but also because the hazard perception is influenced by multiple social factors and workers have different personalities as well. Interactions between individual and social environment is the root cause of hazard perception's adjustment. Therefore, understanding how these social factors interact and drive hazard perception is important for managers to understand how unsafe behavior is fostered. The study analyzed the interaction and causality between the social factors and individual's hazard perception and categorized multiple feedback loops. Hence a system dynamics model was established and a series of experiments were conducted to simulate how the hazard perception evolves under different group environment. The results indicated that (1) dangerous situation tend to result in high level of hazard perception, but the hazard perception would fluctuate inevitably which explains why fatal injury rate stays high for years. And there is a marginal decreasing effect on safety supervision investment, which means when the investment is over optimal value, even the cost of safety supervision increases, but the effect is not noticeable. (2) The unsafe behaviors which is unlikely to cause serious accident are most difficult to regular. Applying both strict safety supervision and regular safety education may achieve an acceptable result. The result also suggested that the plain and simple but regular education is more effective on contrast to in-depth and systematic but long interval learning of safety knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Rail transit plays a very important role in the social and economic development of big cities. Its operational safety is of great significance for ensuring people's lives and maintaining social stability. In this paper, the rail transit operation safety management framework is proposed and analyzed by considering the factors of organizational management, personnel management, equipment and facilities and operating environment together. Considering the fuzzy uncertainty in the process of the safety assessment of rail transit operation (SARTO) and the interrelationship and conflict among the criteria, a new hybrid model combining DEMATEL, ANP and VIKOR with type-2 fuzzy linguistic variables is proposed. The model can present the effect-cause relationship among the different main criteria by the type-2 fuzzy DEMATEL, obtain the weights of the sub-criteria by the type-2 fuzzy ANP and the risk assessment value of each metro line by the type-2 fuzzy VIKOR and give further suggestions for rail transit operation safety management. This novel hybrid methodology is used to evaluate operation safety of metro lines in Beijing, and the sensitivity analysis is also applied to analyze the robustness. For the accuracy and consistency with the actual situation check, the proposed type-2 fuzzy VIKOR method is compared with both TOPSIS method and MOORA method in interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The application of Beijing metro lines proves the feasibility and the practicality of the new hybrid method, which provides effective support for decision-makers in practice. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The study extended the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to better explain and predict the users' intentions to use m-payment services. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 292 m-payment users in Morogoro and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The study used structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis for data analysis. The study found that compatibility, social influence, and m-payment knowledge determined perceived usefulness, while m-payment knowledge, trust and compatibility predicted perceived ease of use of m-payment services. Moreover, perceived ease of use determined perceived usefulness, and perceived usefulness and personal innovativeness in turn, had positive effects on the behavioural intention to use m-payment. There were gender differences on the behavioural intention to use m-payment. The effect of compatibility and personal innovativeness on perceived ease of use, and the influence of ease of use on behavioural intention were moderated by gender such that it is more significant for men more than women. The effects of social influence on perceived usefulness were stronger for female more than their male counterparts.

abstract = {The mining industry is still ranked highly amongst the economic sectors with the highest fatality rates. Earlier approaches to safety have attributed this to the lack of a comprehensive safety management system that employs effective safety barriers. A system theoretic approach to safety provides a better basis for looking deeper into the interaction of technical, workplace and organizational factors, their magnitude of effects, and their time characteristics. This study presents a system dynamics model of safety and production that looks deeper into their organizational tradeoffs. A safety model integrates aspects of safety culture, worker motivation, and human reliability in an effort to examine how risk evolves over time. Additional models of task management and human resources are developed to trace the interactions between safety and production as well as to examine alternative job designs that can reduce risk. The simulation model has been tested for a number of step to increase production demands and the impact on safety over the course of 5 years. HIGHLIGHTS: A methodology has been developed for modeling safety management based on system dynamics. The system dynamics model integrates safety with other organizational processes, such as production and human resources management. System dynamics allow explicit modeling of decision tradeoffs between organizational processes. Emphasis has been given on the evolution of risk over a large period of time where hidden problems may materialize later in the future. {\textcopyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Social engineering attacks pose huge security threats to companies today. These attacks have succeeded mainly because they come from weaknesses that combine the social engineering practices that exploit the human vulnerabilities, with technical skills to bypass the defences of information systems. This paper is founded on the premise that social engineering attacks result from interdependent yet interrelating factors that combine to give an attacker the ability to compromise an individual or organisation's information. We analyse social engineering attacks as a Socio-technical System because it recognises the interaction between people and technology in a work environment. In the case of social engineering attacks, the social subsystem would encompass the people (both victim and attacker), the environmental subsystem would be the environment in which the social engineering attack occurs and the technical subsystem would be the technology used to perform the social engineering attack. The Socio-technical subsystems are further mapped against an existing framework known as the Socio-technical systems framework. This paper applies the currently existing Socio-technical systems framework along with the Socio-technical subsystems mappings to analyse a social engineering attack case study to help identify the underlying factors that made the attack successful. The case study is a popular attack known as 'The Francophone attack', which is an attack that was carried out on a French bank. Through the analysis of the case study, the researchers found that in order to analyse a social engineering attack using the framework, it is pivotal to augment the framework by adding an Information node in the environmental subsystem as one of the aims of any social engineering attacks is to trick you into handing over passwords or other sensitive financial and personal information. The outcome of this research is twofold - firstly, it aims to provide an in-depth perspective into the factors that can allow a social engineering attack to be successful and secondly, to augment the socio-technical systems framework to suit analysis of social engineering attacks when identifying socio-technical system factors.},

In this paper, we try to investigate privacy leakages in Meetup, one of the most popular EBSN service. More specifically, we answer what private information can be inferred from the site's publicly available data. To this end, we conduct a measurement study by crawling webpages from Meetup containing 240K groups, 8.9M users, 27M group affiliations and 78M topical interests. By analyzing the dataset, we find that LGBT status of users, which is one of the most sensitive privacy information, can be predicted with 93% accuracy. Finally we discuss the cause of the privacy leakage on EBSNs and its possible ensuing damages.},

Vulnerabilities in this interface can be leveraged by malicious USB or Bluetooth peripherals to launch pernicious attacks. In this article, we propose ATFuzzer, which uses a grammar-guided evolutionary fuzzing approach that mutates production rules of the AT-command grammar instead of concrete AT commands to evaluate the correctness and robustness of the AT-command execution process. To automate each step of the analysis pipeline, ATFuzzer first takes as input the 3GPP and other vendor-specific standard documents and, following several heuristics, automatically extracts the seed AT command grammars for the fuzzer. ATFuzzer uses the seed to generate both valid and invalid grammars, following our cross-over and mutation strategies to evaluate both the integrity and execution of AT-commands. Empirical evaluation of ATFuzzer on 10 Android smartphones from 6 vendors revealed 4 invalid AT command grammars over Bluetooth and 14 over USB with implications ranging from DoS, downgrade of cellular protocol version, to severe privacy leaks. The vulnerabilities along with the invalid AT-command grammars were responsibly disclosed to affected vendors and assigned CVE's.},

abstract = {Mobile apps have transformed many aspects of clinical practice and are becoming a commonplace in healthcare settings. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has provided the opportunity for such apps to play an important role in reducing the spread of the virus. Several types of COVID-19 apps have enabled healthcare professionals and governments to communicate with the public regarding the pandemic spread, coronavirus awareness, and self-quarantine measures. While these apps provide immense benefits for the containment of the spread, privacy and security of these digital tracing apps are at the center of public debate. To address this gap, we conducted an online survey of a midwestern region in the United State to assess people's attitudes toward such apps and to examine their privacy and security concerns and preferences. Survey results from 1,550 participants indicate that privacy/security protections and trust play a vital role in people's adoption of such apps. Furthermore, results reflect users' preferences wanting to have control over their personal information and transparency on how their data is handled. In addition, personal data protection priorities selected by the participants were surprising and yet revealing of the disconnect between technologists and users. In this article, we present our detailed survey results as well as design guidelines for app developers to develop innovative human-centered technologies that are not only functional but also respectful of social norms and protections of civil liberties. Our study examines users' preferences for COVID-19 apps and integrates important factors of trust, willingness, and preferences in the context of app development. Through our research findings, we suggest mechanisms for designing inclusive apps' privacy and security measures that can be put into practice for healthcare-related apps, so that timely adoption is made possible.},

As healthcare IT infrastructure is characterized by a human element, this study comprehensively examined the effect of psycho-socio-cultural and work factors on security behavior in a typical hospital. A quantitative approach was adopted where we collected responses from 212 healthcare staff through an online questionnaire survey. A broad range of constructs was selected from psychological, social, cultural perception, and work factors based on earlier review work. These were related with some security practices to assess the information security (IS) knowledge, attitude and behavior gaps among healthcare staff in a comprehensive way. The study revealed that work emergency (WE) has a positive correlation with IS conscious care behavior (ISCCB) risk. Conscientiousness also had a positive correlation with ISCCB risk, but agreeableness was negatively correlated with information security knowledge (ISK) risk and information security attitude (ISA) risk. Based on these findings, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation methods combined with cutting-edge technologies can be explored to discourage IS risks behaviors while enhancing conscious care security practice. {\textcopyright} 2022 by the authors.},

abstract = {The emergence of a full-scale quantum computer questions the stability of almost all symmetric and asymmetric cryptography algorithms. At the same time, the rapid growth of computing resources of IT and “G” technologies contributes to an increase in attacks on information and communication (ICS) and cyberphysical systems (CPS). These systems are the core of modern critical cybernetic information systems (CCIS). In such conditions, the primary task of maintaining the required level of security is the classification of modern threats that are integrated with social engineering methods and acquire signs of synergy and hybridity. The paper proposes a synergistic model of threats to ICS/CPS, which takes into account the focus of threats on synergy and hybridity, and the combined impact of security components: information security (IS), cybersecurity (CS), security of information (SI). This approach allows developing methodological foundations for building a unified classifier of threats to cyberphysical systems, forming sets of critical threats, critical points in the ICS/CPS infrastructure elements, based on minimal computing, human and economic costs. The developed methodology for determining the category of an attacker allows systematizing an attacker and, based on the analysis of weighting factors, forming a matrix of correspondence between the capabilities of attackers of various categories and technical means of information security (TMIS). These actions significantly reduce the risk of an attack by certain categories of attackers and allow for planning in the formation of both the IS policy and the corresponding protection profiles.},

abstract = {Twenty five years ago, a major disaster in the North Sea took the lives of 165 persons on board the Piper Alpha oil production platform as well as 2 people from the rescue crew. To this day, the incident represents the worst offshore oil industry disaster ever and has become an industry-changing watershed event. The subsequent Public Inquiry report made a number of recommendations that were related to inherently safer design (ISD), including the mandatory use of a systematic fire and explosion analysis, analysis of smoke and gas ingress to living quarters, and the requirement for a temporary (safe) refuge area capable of surviving the initial fire/explosion. Other recommendations addressed analysis of the vulnerability of safety critical equipment / elements, and evacuation, escape, and rescue in the event of major incidents. Implementation of the above recommendations aimed to reduce the residual risk of the design through the use of an ISD approach. The residual risk then had to be managed by a safety management system (SMS), which is another inquiry recommendation that comprises many of the elements of process safety. Finally, the inquiry recommended developing a Safety Case to describe and justify the design, the inherent hazards and residual risk, and the SMS. This Safety Case is now the basis for periodic audits. Over the past twenty five years this author has had the opportunity to visit offshore production platforms and drilling rigs and to review new offshore projects in many regions of the world. This paper addresses both the strengths and weaknesses observed, and a number of common themes involving management systems, human factors, process safety and integrity management at such facilities. Comparisons will be drawn to the evidence aimed at preventing future major incidents that the author and others presented at the Piper Alpha Inquiry, and to the Inquiry recommendations.},

A nonparametric model, based in Nearest Neighbors combined with Restricted Least Squared methods is developed. Three experts were asked to evaluate the driving risk using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), in order to measure the driving risk in a truck simulator where the vehicle dynamics factors were stored. Numerical results show that the methodology is suitable for embedding in real time systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Survey items developed in behavioral Information Security (InfoSec) research should be practically useful in identifying individuals who are likely to create risk by failing to comply with InfoSec guidance. The literature shows that attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions drive compliance behavior and has influenced the creation of a multitude of training programs focused on improving ones' InfoSec behaviors. While automated controls and directly observable technical indicators are generally preferred by InfoSec practitioners, difficult-to-monitor user actions can still compromise the effectiveness of automatic controls. For example, despite prohibition, doubtful or skeptical employees often increase organizational risk by using the same password to authenticate corporate and external services. Analysis of network traffic or device configurations is unlikely to provide evidence of these vulnerabilities but responses to well-designed surveys might. Guided by the relatively new IPAM model, this study administered 96 survey items from the Behavioral InfoSec literature, across three separate points in time, to 217 respondents. Using systematic feature selection techniques, manageable subsets of 29, 20, and 15 items were identified and tested as predictors of non-compliance with security policy. The feature selection process validates IPAM's innovation in using nuanced self-efficacy and planning items across multiple time frames. Prediction models were trained using several ML algorithms. Practically useful levels of prediction accuracy were achieved with, for example, ensemble tree models identifying 69% of the riskiest individuals within the top 25% of the sample. The findings indicate the usefulness of psychometric items from the behavioral InfoSec in guiding training programs and other cybersecurity control activities and demonstrate that they are promising as additional inputs to AI models that monitor networks for security events.},

abstract = {The analysts at a cybersecurity operations center (CSOC) analyze the alerts that are generated by intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Under normal operating conditions, sufficient numbers of analysts are available to analyze the alert workload. For the purpose of this article, this means that the cybersecurity analysts in each shift can fully investigate each and every alert that is generated by the IDSs in a reasonable amount of time and perform their normal tasks in a shift. Normal tasks include analysis time, time to attend training programs, report writing time, personal break time, and time to update the signatures on new patterns in alerts as detected by the IDS. There are several disruptive factors that occur randomly and can adversely impact the normal operating condition of a CSOC, such as (1) higher alert generation rates from a few IDSs, (2) new alert patterns that decrease the throughput of the alert analysis process, and (3) analyst absenteeism. The impact of the preceding factors is that the alerts wait for a long duration before being analyzed, which impacts the level of operational effectiveness (LOE) of the CSOC. To return the CSOC to normal operating conditions, the manager of a CSOC can take several actions, such as increasing the alert analysis time spent by analysts in a shift by canceling a training program, spending some of his own time to assist the analysts in alert investigation, and calling upon the on-call analyst workforce to boost the service rate of alerts. However, additional resources are limited in quantity over a 14-day work cycle, and the CSOC manager must determine when and how much action to take in the face of uncertainty, which arises from both the intensity and the random occurrences of the disruptive factors. The preceding decision by the CSOC manager is nontrivial and is often made in an ad hoc manner using prior experiences. This work develops a reinforcement learning (RL) model for optimizing the LOE throughout the entire 14-day work cycle of a CSOC in the face of uncertainties due to disruptive events. Results indicate that the RL model is able to assist the CSOCmanager with a decision support tool to make better decisions than current practices in determining when and how much resource to allocate when the LOE of a CSOC deviates from the normal operating condition.},

abstract = {Human reaction plays a key role in improved protection upon emergent traffic situations with motor vehicles. Understanding the underlying behaviour mechanisms can combine active sensing system on feature caption and passive devices on injury mitigation for automated vehicles. The study aims to identify the distance-based safety boundary (“safety envelope”) of vehicle–pedestrian conflicts via pedestrian active avoidance behaviour recorded in well-controlled, immersive virtual reality-based emergent traffic scenarios. Via physiological signal measurement and kinematics reconstruction of the complete sequence, we discovered the general perception-decision-action mechanisms under given external stimulus, and the resultant certain level of natural harm-avoidance action. Using vision as the main information source, 70% pedestrians managed to avoid the collision by adapting walking speeds and directions, consuming overall less “decision” time (0.17–0.24 s vs. 0.41 s) than the collision cases, after that, pedestrians need enough “execution” time (1.52–1.84 s) to take avoidance action. Safety envelopes were generated by combining the simultaneous interactions between the pedestrian and the vehicle. The present investigation on emergent reaction dynamics clears a way for realistic modelling of biomechanical behaviour, and preliminarily demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating in vivo pedestrian behaviour into engineering design which can facilitate improved, interactive on-board devices towards global optimal safety. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s).},

While susceptibility in young users declined across the study, susceptibility in older users remained stable. The relative effectiveness of the attacks differed by weapons of influence and life domains with age-group variability. In addition, older compared to young users reported lower susceptibility awareness.

abstract = {Physical security systems (PSS) and humans are inescapably tied in the current physical security paradigm. Yet, physical security system evaluations often end at the console that displays information to the human. That is, these evaluations do not account for human-in-The-loop factors that can greatly impact performance of the security system, even though methods for doing so are well-established. This paper highlights two examples of methods for evaluating the human component of the current physical security system. One of these methods is qualitative, focusing on the information the human needs to adequately monitor alarms on a physical site. The other of these methods objectively measures the impact of false alarm rates on threat detection. These types of human-centric evaluations are often treated as unnecessary or not cost effective under the belief that human cognition is straightforward and errors can be either trained away or mitigated with technology. These assumptions are not always correct, are often surprising, and can often only be identified with objective assessments of human-system performance. Thus, taking the time to perform human element evaluations can identify unintuitive human-system weaknesses and can provide significant cost savings in the form of mitigating vulnerabilities and reducing costly system patches or retrofits to correct an issue after the system has been deployed. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

Also, it requires a focus on how people actually perform, not how they are presumed to perform according to textbook situations. In this paper, a framework to analyze adaptive behavior in everyday situations in which systems are working near the margins of safety is presented. Further, the variety space diagram has been developed as a means to illustrate how system variability, disturbances, and constraints affect work performance.

We particularly focus on how this labor of maintaining and sustaining changes as projects and their software grow and scale across many dimensions.

Contemporary investigations of accidents occurred in high-technology systems highlighted the connection between human-related issues and major events, which led to catastrophic consequences. Consequently, the understanding of human behavioural characteristics interlaced with current technology aspects and organisational context seems to be of paramount importance for the safety & reliability field. First, significant drawbacks related to the human performance data collection will be minimised by the development of a novel industrial accidents dataset, the Multi-attribute Technological Accidents Dataset (MATA-D), which groups 238 major accidents from different industrial backgrounds and classifies them under a common framework (the Contextual Control Model used as basis for the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method). The accidents collection and the detailed interpretation will provide a rich data source, enabling the usage of integrated information to generate input to design improvement schemes. Then, implications to improve robustness of system design and tackle the surrounding factors and tendencies that could lead to the manifestation of human errors will be effectively addressed. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to introduce a risk-driven investment process model for analysing human factors that allows information security managers to capture possible risk-investment relationships and to reason about them. The overall success of an information security system depends on analysis of the risks and threats so that appropriate protection mechanism can be in place to protect them. However, lack of appropriate analysis of risks may potentially results in failure of information security systems. Existing literature does not provide adequate guidelines for a systematic process or an appropriate modelling language to support such analysis. This work aims to fill this gap by introducing the process and reason about the risks considering human factors. Design/methodology/approach-To develop risk-driven investment model along with the activities that support the process. These objectives were achieved through the collection of quantitative and qualitative data utilising requirements engineering and secure tropos methods. Findings-The proposed process and model lead to define a clear relationship between risks, incidents and investment and allows organisations to calculate them based on their own figures. Research limitations/implications-One of the major limitations of this model is that it only supports incident-based investment. This creates some sort of difficulties to be presented to the executive board. Secondly, because of the nature of human factors, quantification does not exactly reflect the monetary value of the factors. Practical implications-Applying the information security risk-driven investment model in a real case study shows that this can help organisations apply and use it in other incidents, and more importantly, to the incidents which critical human factors are a grave concern of organisations. The importance of providing a financial justification is clearly highlighted and provided for seeking investment in information security. Social implications-It has a big social impact that technically could lead for cost justifications and decision-making process. This would impact the whole society by helping individuals to keep their data safe. Originality/value-The novel contribution of this work is to analyse specific critical human factors which have subjective natures in an objective and dynamic domain of risk, security and investment. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The quantification of organizational mechanisms remains a vital challenge for Human Reliability Assessment (HRA) and Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA). This paper reports on the progress of ongoing research by the authors to (a) identify the social and organizational factors that affect technological system risk, (b) examine how and why these factors influence risk, and (c) specify, in conjunction with PRA, how much they contribute to risk. The authors advance the Socio-Technical Risk Analysis (SoTeRiA) framework that explicitly integrates both the social aspects (e.g., safety culture) and the structural features (e.g., safety practices) of organizations with technical system risk models. While SoTeRiA represents a significant improvement in the integration of organizational factors in PRA, the theoretical details of underlying contributing factors and causal interrelationships for each generic node should be expanded. In addition to the theoretical advancements, a major challenge of quantifying organizational factors for PRA relates to lack of reliable data. This research uses a new approach, highlighting that data is available for organizational factors; however, with a different nature from tabular numerical equipment reliability data. The nature of data for organizational factors is evolving to an 'organizational-level' of analysis, i.e., organizational communications. The Data-Theoretic methodology is a hybrid combination of theoretical conceptualization and data analytics to quantify organizational mechanisms. With this approach, the strength of human interpretation (i.e., systematic interpretation and expert opinion) is utilized along with theoretical constructs to develop adequate causality for guiding new big data analytic algorithms aimed at large unstructured and heterogeneous data of textual organizational communications. This paper highlights the two primary parts of the Data-Theoretic methodology: (1) DT-BASE: Develop factors, sub-factors, and causal relationships in SoTeRiA, equipped with a base quantification grounded on theories and interpretation of information in the literature and reports and (2) DT-SITE: Develop site-specific measurement techniques to quantify the causal models based on site-specific data, utilizing automated data extraction and inference methods. {\textcopyright} 2017 by American Nuclear Society.

abstract = {Internet distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are prevalent but hard to defend against, partially due to the volatility of the attacking methods and patterns used by attackers. Understanding the latest DDoS attacks can provide new insights for effective defense. But most of existing understandings are based on indirect traffic measures (e.g., backscatters) or traffic seen locally. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis based on 50 704 different Internet DDoS attacks directly observed in a seven-month period. These attacks were launched by 674 botnets from 23 different botnet families with a total of 9026 victim IPs belonging to 1074 organizations in 186 countries. Our analysis reveals several interesting findings about today's Internet DDoS attacks. Some highlights include: 1) geolocation analysis shows that the geospatial distribution of the attacking sources follows certain patterns, which enables very accurate source prediction of future attacks for most active botnet families; 2) from the target perspective, multiple attacks to the same target also exhibit strong patterns of inter-attack time interval, allowing accurate start time prediction of the next anticipated attacks from certain botnet families; and 3) there is a trend for different botnets to launch DDoS attacks targeting the same victim, simultaneously or in turn. These findings add to the existing literature on the understanding of today's Internet DDoS attacks and offer new insights for designing new defense schemes at different levels.},

Information technology aims to ensure the sustainability and success of the company by anticipating, exploiting the benefits, and minimizing vulnerabilities to potential threats to work with such categories of personnel as key employees. The stage that is the subject of the study is related to the identification of personnel. It is carried out on the basis of the analysis of conformity of possibilities of the respondent to requirements to various groups of competencies defined by the profile of key employees formed in the company. In this study, the stage of identification of key employees is considered as a human-machine toolkit, built on a system-linked base of peer review models using modern capabilities of decision support systems in a weak process structuring and conceptual uncertainty. Its information result - an indicator of identification and a database of diverse assessments of employee competence - is considered as one of the basic in assessing potential threats to company assets, their vulnerabilities, expected costs, finding ways to minimize them in the next stages of information technology risk management of key employees. {\textcopyright} 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

abstract = {Phishing scam emails are emails that pretend to be something they are not in order to get the recipient of the email to undertake some action they normally would not. While technical protections against phishing reduce the number of phishing emails received, they are not perfect and phishing remains one of the largest sources of security risk in technology and communication systems. To better understand the cognitive process that end users can use to identify phishing messages, I interviewed 21 IT experts about instances where they successfully identified emails as phishing in their own inboxes. IT experts naturally follow a three-stage process for identifying phishing emails. In the first stage, the email recipient tries to make sense of the email, and understand how it relates to other things in their life. As they do this, they notice discrepancies: little things that are "off'' about the email. As the recipient notices more discrepancies, they feel a need for an alternative explanation for the email. At some point, some feature of the email-usually, the presence of a link requesting an action-triggers them to recognize that phishing is a possible alternative explanation. At this point, they become suspicious (stage two) and investigate the email by looking for technical details that can conclusively identify the email as phishing. Once they find such information, then they move to stage three and deal with the email by deleting it or reporting it. I discuss ways this process can fail, and implications for improving training of end users about phishing.},

This invites a discussion about the role of national culture in aviation accidents. This study makes a cross-cultural comparison between Oman, Taiwan and the USA. Method. A cross-cultural comparison was acquired using data from three studies, including this study, by applying the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) framework. The Taiwan study presented 523 mishaps with 1762 occurrences of human error obtained from the Republic of China Air Force. The study from the USA carried out for commercial aviation had 119 accidents with 245 instances of human error. This study carried out in Oman had a total of 40 aircraft accidents with 129 incidences. Results. Variations were found between Oman, Taiwan and the USA at the levels of organisational influence and unsafe supervision. Seven HFACS categories showed significant differences between the three countries (p < 0.05). Conclusion. Although not given much consideration, national culture can have an impact on aviation safety. This study revealed that national culture plays a role in aircraft accidents related to human factors that cannot be disregarded. {\textcopyright} 2016 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).},

In our review, we propose that much of the research on risk perceptions to date can be grouped according to three dominant perspectives and, thus, approaches to study design; they are: the characteristics of hazards, the characteristics of risk perceivers, and the application of heuristics to inform risk judgments. In making these distinctions, we also highlight what we see as outstanding challenges for researchers and practitioners.

abstract = {The more the risk level the lesser the safety and vice versa. The history of risk evaluation is moving from the point of accident investigation toward prior determination of quantum risk level. The risk level assessment is a part of risk evaluation process for identifying the risk aspects, impacts, hazard significance, and operational hazards. Risk assessment process helps for appropriate design of risk control procedures, to suggest provision of safety adequacy measures to reduce risk consequences, avoid or mitigate risks, and hazards. Risk free and failure free or fail-safe Operations in Safety-Critical Systems may not lead to loss of equipment, financial loss, environmental damage and hazard to human life. Prevailing standard techniques point out various risk factors and map out potential points where a safety critical operation can fail. The development of a framework is based on prevailing applicable standards and deals with safety-risk assessment for safety automation of safety-critical system operations. To explore various underlying risk factors, impacts and evaluation for determining risk magnitude, attributes and probabilities exhaustively considering practical conditions, a framework for safety automation of safety-critical operations is proposed. The methodology identifies underlying risk factors and determines risk significance for occupational and financial. Based on the identifications, a ten point scale to assess safety-risks is derived. The results of framework application to power plant case showed substantial improvement in assessing risks when compared to existing risk assessments. This is an indication of prevailing limited/inadequate safety-risk assessment in deeply addressing associated operational risks, proving the framework useful. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

We present both quantitative and qualitative results from 28 pairs of novices as they use Private WebMail (Pwm), Tutanota, and Virtru and 10 pairs of novices as they use Mailvelope. Participants report being more at ease with this type of study and better able to cope with mistakes since both participants are “on the same page.” We find that users prefer integrated solutions over depot-based solutions and that tutorials are important in helping first-time users. Finally, our results demonstrate that Pretty Good Privacy using manual key management is still unusable for novice users, with 9 of 10 participant pairs failing to complete the study.},

Better ways of defining and measuring these expressions may therefore be useful both in understanding how social identity is expressed in text, and how the self is presented on Twitter. To this end, the present work makes three contributions. First, using qualitative methods, we identify and define the concept of a personal identifier, which is more representative of the ways in which identity is signaled in Twitter bios. Second, we propose a method to extract all personal identifiers expressed in a given bio. Finally, we present a series of validation analyses that explore the strengths and limitations of our proposed method. Our work opens up exciting new opportunities at the intersection between the social psychological study of social identity and the study of how we compose the self through markers of identity on Twitter and in social media more generally.},

abstract = {This paper presents an anti-spoofing design to verify whether a voice command is spoken by one live legal user, which supplements existing speech recognition systems and could enable new application potentials when many crucial voice commands need a higher-standard verification in applications. In the literature, verifying the liveness and legality of the command's speaker has been studied separately. However, to accept a voice command from a live legal user, prior solutions cannot be combined directly due to two reasons. First, previous methods have introduced various sensing channels for the liveness detection, while the safety of a sensing channel itself cannot be guaranteed. Second, a direct combination is also vulnerable when an attacker plays a recorded voice command from the legal user and mimics this user to speak the command simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce an anti-spoofing sensing channel to fulfill the design. More importantly, our design provides a generic interface to form the sensing channel, which is compatible to a variety of widely-used signals, including RFID, Wi-Fi and acoustic signals. This offers a flexibility to balance the system cost and verification requirement. We develop a prototype system with three versions by using these sensing signals. We conduct extensive experiments in six different real-world environments under a variety of settings to examine the effectiveness of our design.},

abstract = {Failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) is a proactive quality tool that allows the identification and prevention of the potential failure modes of a process or product. In a conventional FMECA, for each failure mode, three risk parameters, namely frequency, non-detection, and severity are evaluated and a risk priority number (RPN) is calculated by multiplying these parameters to assess one signal criticality. However, in many cases, it suffers from some shortcomings regarding the decision-making and the situation where the information provided is ambiguous or uncertain. This paper describes a new fuzzy multi-criticality approach for improving the use of FMECA by treating FMECA as a fuzzy multi-criteria optimization model. The new approach bases on replacing the calculation of a single criticality with a fuzzy inference system for improving the criticality evaluations which offers five partial criticalities that efficiently and separately calculate the impact of a failure on the environment, personnel, production, equipment, and management. In addition, an analytical hierarchy method (AHP) is used to calculate the priorities weights for each partial criticality and construct a criticality matrix in order to improve the relevance of decision-making. Furthermore, a real case of LPG storage system for ZCINA Hassi Messaoud in Algeria is provided to illustrate the practical implementation of the suggested approach and extremely shows the pertinence of the suggested fuzzy model as decision-making tools in preventing industrial risks with providing encouraging results regarding the criticality estimation and improve decision-making by prioritizing 'preventive-corrective actions' and determine the efficient action for each partial criticality to control the risk effectively.  {\textcopyright} 2021-IOS Press.

abstract = {Technological innovations and new areas of application introduce new challenges related to safety and control of risk in the maritime industry. Dynamically positioned systems are increasingly used, contributing to a higher level of autonomy and complexity aboard maritime vessels. Currently, risk assessment and verification of dynamically positioned systems are focused on technical reliability, and the main effort is centered on design and demonstration of redundancy in order to protect against component failures. In this article, we argue that factors, such as software-requirement errors, human errors, including unsafe or too late decision-making, and inadequate coordination between decision makers, also should be considered in the risk assessments. Hence, we investigate the feasibility of using a systems approach to analyzing risk in dynamically positioned systems and present an adapted version of the system-theoretic process analysis. A case study where the system-theoretic process analysis is applied to a dynamically positioned system is conducted to assess whether this method significantly expands the current view on safety of dynamically positioned systems. The results indicate that the reliability-centered approaches, such as the failure mode and effect analysis, sea trials, and hardware-in-the-loop testing, are insufficient and that their view on safety is too narrow. This article shows that safety constraints can be violated in a number of manners other than component failures for dynamically positioned systems, and hence, system-theoretic process analysis complements the currently applied methods. {\textcopyright} IMechE 2016.},

abstract = {Context: Demonstrating high reliability and safety for safety-critical systems (SCSs) remains a hard problem. Diverse evidence needs to be combined in a rigorous way: in particular, results of operational testing with other evidence from design and verification. Growing use of machine learning in SCSs, by precluding most established methods for gaining assurance, makes evidence from operational testing even more important for supporting safety and reliability claims. Objective: We revisit the problem of using operational testing to demonstrate high reliability. We use Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as a current example. AVs are making their debut on public roads: methods for assessing whether an AV is safe enough are urgently needed. We demonstrate how to answer 5 questions that would arise in assessing an AV type, starting with those proposed by a highly-cited study. Method: We apply new theorems extending our Conservative Bayesian Inference (CBI) approach, which exploit the rigour of Bayesian methods while reducing the risk of involuntary misuse associated (we argue) with now-common applications of Bayesian inference; we define additional conditions needed for applying these methods to AVs. Results: Prior knowledge can bring substantial advantages if the AV design allows strong expectations of safety before road testing. We also show how naive attempts at conservative assessment may lead to over-optimism instead; why extrapolating the trend of disengagements (take-overs by human drivers) is not suitable for safety claims; use of knowledge that an AV has moved to a “less stressful” environment. Conclusion: While some reliability targets will remain too high to be practically verifiable, our CBI approach removes a major source of doubt: it allows use of prior knowledge without inducing dangerously optimistic biases. For certain ranges of required reliability and prior beliefs, CBI thus supports feasible, sound arguments. Useful conservative claims can be derived from limited prior knowledge. {\textcopyright} 2020},

abstract = {Accident rates appear to be slightly lower in tunnels than on open road, however an accident in a tunnel may have much greater impact; especially in the event of fire, where the enclosed space hinders the dissipation of smoke and poses difficulty in ensuring safe escape route of the tunnel users. In order to assess the risk of such events that may cause heavy losses as well as serious damage to the tunnel infrastructure and facilities, it is crucial to focus on the key elements that constitute the road tunnel system. Taking into account that the road tunnel operator's performance is of utmost importance for the overall safety of these critical infrastructures, this paper examines the cognitive overload that may occur during emergency situations. The analysis reveals that the main factors that have a substantial effect on the mental effort of the tunnel operator are the level of information processing, the available time to complete the necessary tasks and the number of switches the operator has to make between different task-sets. In order to improve the operator's performance and reduce the mental workload in this safety critical domain of the transportation system, various performance shaping mechanisms are analyzed in a holistic and systemic perspective. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Pedestrian-vehicle conflicts are one of the most important safety concerns at signalized intersections especially in urban areas. Conflicting vehicles and pedestrians select their maneuvers by predicting the other user behavior. Sudden behavioral changes of pedestrians such as sudden speed change (acceleration or deceleration) cannot be predicted by drivers, which can lead to safety hazards especially if these sudden behavioral changes occur near conflict areas. In this study, continuous pedestrian speed profiles were analyzed at signalized crosswalks to investigate the existence of such behavioral changes. A methodology is proposed to identify significant sudden changes of pedestrian speeds. The locations and timings of these sudden speed change events were analyzed, and the influencing factors such as crosswalk geometry and signal timing were studies and evaluated. Five signalized crosswalks at three intersections in Nagoya City were videotaped for analysis. Individual pedestrian maneuvers were extracted with image processing software. Empirical analysis showed that sudden acceleration events were observed at the entrance points to the pedestrian-vehicle conflict area, which highlights the significance of these events to pedestrian-vehicle conflict analysis. A multinomial logit model was developed to estimate the probability of a pedestrian making a sudden speed change as a function of different influencing factors. The results implied that the entering speed, necessary speed to finish crossing before the onset of the pedestrian signal red phase, and crosswalk length have a significant impact on speed change choices. This paper presents important suggestions to understanding pedestrian maneuvers in detail from the viewpoint of safety. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The Japanese High-Speed Railway (HSR), is renowned for its impeccable safety record of zero passenger fatalities. However, a limited academic discussion has taken place on the organizational and institutional factors affecting HSR safety in Japan, as opposed to technological solutions. A recent series of HSR accidents in Japan have also warranted attention on organizational and institutional factors affecting HSR safety. The objective of the present study is to utilize systems approach to highlight the current organizational and institutional safety issues within Japanese HSR, and to provide a discussion on improving current practices. First, the study develops a taxonomy of accident causes in Japanese HSR, using previously unanalyzed official accident reports available only in Japanese. The taxonomy analysis reveals common accident causal factors, including the failure to sense degradation in procedures, and the failure to establish knowledge-based on thorough risk assessments. The paper then presents an in-depth analysis of the only “Serious Accident” in Japanese HSR. Information on the serious accident obtained through official accident reports and expert interviews is combined using a System-Theoretic Accident Model and Process (STAMP) analysis, which reveal a new accident archetype at the organizational and institutional level. The archetype demonstrates the common failure causes for the operator and the regulator, thereby making their apparent redundancy ineffective. The archetype is helpful in identifying theoretical improvements in current safety practices. The study also concludes that the adoption of a systematic risk-assessment approach is necessary to enable proactive safety management in complex ultra-safe systems like the Japanese HSR. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {This article establishes and addresses opportunities for ethics integration into Machine Learning (ML) courses. Following a survey of the history of computing ethics and the current need for ethical consideration within ML, we consider the current state of ML ethics education via an exploratory analysis of course syllabi in computing programs. The results reveal that though ethics is part of the overall educational landscape in these programs, it is not frequently a part of core technical ML courses. To help address this gap, we offer a preliminary framework, developed via a systematic literature review, of relevant ethics questions that should be addressed within an ML project. A pilot study with 85 students confirms that this framework helped them identify and articulate key ethical considerations within their ML projects. Building from this work, we also provide three example ML course modules that bring ethical thinking directly into learning core ML content. Collectively, this research demonstrates: (1) the need for ethics to be taught as integrated within ML coursework, (2) a structured set of questions useful for identifying and addressing potential issues within an ML project, and (3) novel course models that provide examples for how to practically teach ML ethics without sacrificing core course content. An additional by-product of this research is the collection and integration of recent publications in the emerging field of ML ethics education.},

abstract = {Despite the general trend of injury reduction, the risk of injury to workers in the coal industry, especially in underground coal mining, is one of the highest both in Russia and abroad. Numerous studies have determined that the human factor is the cause of 70—90%; of incidents, accidents and casualties. That is why any modern production facility requires a reliable forecast of injuries caused by incompetent actions of employees in order to plan managerial decisions aimed at reducing the number of accidents. Using a new model of the human factor, where the human factor is defined as a difference in time and space between the actual level of the complex of a person's abilities and the required level of the complex of abilities, the methods of evaluation of the reliability of the human factor have been developed, making it possible to forecast the number of accidents. To make the forecast the results of determining the levels of employees' competence obtained during the operation of the “Video information system of continuous development and control of employees' competence in the sphere of occupational safety and health” at JSC SUEK-Kuzbass and data on the occupational traumatism were used. Results of calculations of reliability of the human factor and risks of traumatism for various groups of competence: competent, low-competent and incompetent are given. It is shown that continuous express training sharply reduces the probability of injury in low-competent and incompetent workers. {\textcopyright} 2022 Publishing house Mining book.

Yet, it is challenging to make the best of both the philosophies in a period of knowledge transition when they may have to coexist. This work investigates how Safety-II may resemble, differ from, and correlate to Safety-I. From individual, environmental and organizational aspects, 9 impacting factors are identified and expounded comparatively in the two philosophies. To examine impact of the factors on accidents and resilience respectively, an empirical approach is presented in the context of Beijing taxi service system (BTSS). Multiple means such as questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, and statistical analysis with bi-method (Correlation Analysis, and Data Envelopment Analysis) cross-checking are utilized comprehensively to support the empirical study. The results show that: a) individual factors play a dominant role in system risk/performance management, in respect to views of both Safety-I and II; and b) organizational factors are more influential in creating and maintaining system resilience. Based on the findings, possible patterns of integrating the two philosophies are instantiated through mutually complementary application to BTSS. Despite the context of BTSS, this work provides a feasible way of comparing between Safety-I and Safety-II, for beneficial reference of other socio-technical systems. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Automation provides many new and improved abilities for ships and offshore assets. Automation is more than the mere replacement of the functions of older (less optimal) systems; it requires system interoperability and integration. Interconnectivity of multiple systems adds new risk factors to the system as a whole. Two key risk factors are cyber security and system complexity. At a high-level, cybersecurity means understanding your systems and processes, your personnel's capabilities and limitations, as well as thoroughly evaluating your threat landscape. In other words, system owners must have a keen understanding that there will always be new threats to counter, and new technologies to harness. With improvements in cyber security systems, employees are now the preeminent target, thus making them a substantial vulnerability. Through negligence (human error) and malicious acts - including being the victim of phishing/whaling attacks, lost laptops, accidental disclosure of information, and actions of rogue employees account for up to two-thirds of all cyber-related breaches. Industry must be cognizant that added complexity (e.g., system design/arrangement, rules, policies, procedures, etc.,) can decrease an individual's situational awareness and increase the likelihood of human error. A key to effective systems-risk assessment and complexity management lay in understanding cyber safety system designs, and how people interact with those systems. This paper will discuss methods to engineer systems, control system complexity, and how to help mitigate human error, with the goal of creating an efficient and effective cyber security environment. {\textcopyright} 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.},

abstract = {This paper describes a framework for Crew-Centred Design aimed at improving the human factors integration into the design process. Although the framework could be applied by any end-user or stakeholder particular emphasis is given to ship designers and naval architects. This emphasis can be justified by the fact that equipment manufactures and designers already have to take into account several of the human factors aspects, namely ergonomics and human machine interface, whereas there is an identified lack of a holistic approach to the overall ship design (integration of developed equipment, habitability, etc.). The framework applies to a large part of the ship life cycle, i.e., from the user requirements until the implementation process (i.e., construction and operation) and follows, in a sense, the IMO's risk-based framework "Formal Safety Assessment (FSA)". The proposed framework is based on the application of the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method to the different phases of the ship life cycle. In order to illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework a particular activity of a given scenario is analysed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {This paper is an update of a Work-in-Progress presented at the ASEE 2021 virtual conference [1] and includes new data from after the 2021 paper was accepted for publication. An undergraduate research experience was developed in response to an Office of Naval Research program seeking to develop “innovative solutions that directly maintain, or cultivate a diverse, world-class STEM workforce in order to maintain the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps' technological superiority.” During the fall 2020 semester, nine students were recruited to participate in a UAS cybersecurity-focused undergraduate research experience. Three faculty members each identified a small topic area for undergraduate students to pursue. The three areas are: 1. Small UAS (sUAS) Vulnerability and Threat Assessment and Mitigation 2. Effects of Cyber Attacks on Communication in UAS Swarms with Distributed Swarm Control 3. Enhancing Security of Cloud-Connected UAS Services Students were placed onto teams based on their prior course experiences and the project requirements. Common resources were provided for all students to train them in conducting research. Teams were then tasked with developing a more comprehensive research plan for their specific project and carrying out that plan throughout the 2020-2021 academic year. A no-cost extension was granted to enable six students who had not graduated to continue into the Fall 2021 semester with the goals of completing their work and publishing the results in an academic outlet. Three students continued into the Spring 2022 semester finishing their publication work. Year 1 of the program was assessed by having students take a pre-, mid-, and post- survey and conducting a brief interview about their experiences. Students took a pre-survey at the start of the project and a mid-project survey shortly before the winter break. They completed the post survey and interview during the final week of the Spring semester in Year 1. Five students who remained with the project in Year 2 also completed a “final year” survey at the end of the Fall term in year 2. The surveys were a combination of project specific skills questions as well as relevant questions from the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA), an NSF funded assessment tool to measure student gains in research skills. This paper will describe the broader project, the individual student team projects and the outcomes of those projects, and results from the surveys and interviews. The purpose of this paper is to provide an example approach for future undergraduate research programs looking for practical approaches to implementing undergraduate research programs, particularly those in the cybersecurity area. {\textcopyright} American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.},

A wide variety of hazard identification and risk analysis methods are available to support process safety decisions. All methods require knowledge in the fundamentals of process design and experience in the process operation under consideration. Every method has uncertainty and no method yields any better reflection of the risk than the level of engagement that the analyst or team has in the assessment. Traditional approaches work well on processes with a long history of operation, but are difficult to apply in the rapidly evolving environment of modern manufacturing. This article discusses the challenges that the risk analysis process is facing in today's work environment. These challenges include understanding that the calculations are only a model for process safety events that harm people, events with low calculated likelihood can still occur, and management systems with metrics are critical to sustain the performance of the identified protection layers. These challenges are met by adapting current tools and work processes for recording process data to also collect data on abnormal operation and protection layer failure. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.},

abstract = {Weak control of human factors leads directly to error. An error can result in an initiating event of an accident sequence (directly by the mistake made or indirectly, such as by a process control loop failing prematurely). Human error is also the cause of failure of each layer of protection. This paper discusses each of the 10 primary human factors and describes what we know about their relative importance in accident causation. The data presented is from basic research by the authors on the root causes of more than 2000 accidents and near misses; and also based on the review on the review of hundreds of accidents analyzed by others and on summary data from many companies. This paper lists where focus should be placed (i.e., which human factors tend to be key) and provides proven ways to optimize these human factors so that the base human error rate at a site is as low as possible. Tie in to other applications, such as determining the probability of human error for risk analysis is also presented. Case studies and examples are used to illustrate key points.

abstract = {Digital-only banks have not achieved adoption expectations despite being one of the latest innovations in fintech. Several digital-only banks in the United States and Japan have gone bankrupt, and others continue to operate at a loss. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct this study in Malaysia to understand customers' behavior, particularly regarding the adoption of digital-only banks. With climate change, environmental-friendly behavior, which has been ignored in digital-only bank literature, is becoming increasingly pertinent. This study addresses the lack of an integrated model that investigates the effect of external factors (i.e., critical mass, number of services, and environmental concerns), customer self-determination factors (i.e., trust), and mental perceptions of technology adoption (i.e., convenience, economic efficiency, functional and security risks, as well as perceived value) on the intention to adopt digital-only banks. Data were collected through an online survey targeting Klang Valley residents in the prime age range of 25–54 years old using stratified random sampling. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling by performing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and SEM path analysis in AMOS.v26 software. The results show that convenience, economic efficiency, number of services, trust, perceived value, and environmental concern all have positive significant relationships with the intention to adopt digital-only banks. Further, environmental concern is the strongest indicator of behavioral intention. In contrast, functional and security risks have a negative but non-significant relationship with the intention to adopt digital-only banks. Finally, critical mass has a positive but non-significant effect on the behavioral intention. This study is among the first to examine the influence of environmental concern on behavioral intentions in a digital-only banking context. It also contributes to an expanding body of research investigating environmental sustainability by presenting empirical results in the context of digital-only banks. {\textcopyright} 2022 by the authors.},

abstract = {Since the first missions and until today,the aerospace industry has been making significant technological advances and developments,working in the edge of innovation and technology. Despite the considerable advances in this sector,the degree of complexity and the risks associated are inherent to the process. In this sense,the development of safety strategies,including human factors approach,is a way to promote process safety in the design of the projects,construction,operation,and maintenance,in land,air and space. Although NASA had implemented several safety barriers in their operations since its beginning,some major accidents occurred,notably Columbia (2003) and Challenger (1986). At the same time,workplaces in the oil and gas (O&G) industry have evolved to become part of the modern complex sociotechnical system that characterizes onshore and offshore facilities today. The intense interactions between workers,systems,equipment,and processes have made companies in this sector more productive,but significant and complex risks have also emerged. This industry has a history of several accidents,such as Piper Alpha (1988),Texas City Refinery (2005) and Deepwater Horizon (2010),causing heavy losses and global geopolitical changes. All these accidents,in aerospace and O&G industries,involved machines and system that are operating in the very limit of engineering,specially in the sharp end of the operations. Having both industries as background,this study presents a human factor approach to assess two relevant accidents,using the FRAM (Functional Resonance Analysis Method) to perform this analysis.

abstract = {Human-related errors, which are usually unpredictable, are one of the major causes of most incidents and accidents on construction sites. By taking the advantages of context-aware technology, the personalized safety management, an effective method to avoid human-related errors, becomes possible. The CA-HFACS model is promoted to manage such human errors, combing the Context-aware technology (CA) and Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). First, the personalized factors influencing construction safety performance are summarized from related literatures. These personalized factors incorporate 20 risk factors that are categorized into 5 levels: L1: Health condition, L2: Mental state, L3: Weather, L4: Act properly, and L5: History state. Subsequently, the relationship between these factors and project safety performance is showed in the CA-HFACS model. These factors are then validated by data collected with questionnaires, and the process of data collection is also demonstrated. Finally, the proposed model is applied to a high-speed railway project with PSIM system, a software developed by the authors. The application demonstrates the models abilities to systematically collect safety data of on-site workers, thus largely improving safety assessment capabilities and effectively creating a safer environment for the workers concerned. {\textcopyright} 2019 IEEE.},

The aim of performing analysis is often to identify potential problematic permissions, which have the potential to be exploited and could result in data theft and unintended modification. There is a vast body of published literature on analysing access control systems, yet as performing analysis has a strong end-user motivation and is grounded in security challenges faced in real-world systems, it is important to understand how research is developing, what are the common themes of interest, and to identify key challenges that should be addressed in future work. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no survey has been performed to gain an understanding of empirical access control analysis, focussing on how techniques are evaluated and how they align to the needs of real-world analysis tasks.

abstract = {The HAZOP method is commonly used in identifying causes and consequences of hazard scenarios and the required safeguards in confirming the engineering design for process safety. The LOPA method is then often used to provide a semi-quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the identified safeguards to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Where gaps exist, this method provides initial input into determination of required risk reduction factors or safety integrity levels for safety instrumented systems. Integration of HAZOP and LOPA techniques into a single study has been accomplished and this provides the practical advantage of utilizing the same team of subject matter experts to complete the evaluation of hazard scenarios, to identify the need for further risk reduction, and to recommend the specific safeguards required and confirm that the resulting residual risk will be acceptable. While practical and efficient, the one-step comprehensive integrated HAZOP/LOPA method can have pitfalls. For example, the LOPA method isn't always appropriate for scenarios that may have high initiating event frequencies, such as repetitive manual or semi-automatic batch operations. In this case, use of standard initiating event frequencies for control failures or operator error could result in understating the risk. A human factors task analysis may be the more appropriate tool. Likewise, HAZOP/LOPA teams are usually instructed to provide concrete recommendations when additional safeguards are required, rather than just calling for further study. In some cases this could lead to costly overdesign. In particular, use of LOPA alone to confirm risk acceptability can lead to complex solutions to meet the relatively conservative order-of-magnitude threshold requirements for independent protection layers (IPLs). Quantitative methods are sometimes required beyond HAZOP/LOPA to obtain a more precise evaluation of the identified hazards. These quantitative methods are useful for design evaluations and recommendation resolutions when major capital expenditures need additional justification (e.g. when SIL-2 or 3 systems are required). This paper presents a risk assessment approach incorporating human factors task analysis and fault tree and/or event tree analysis following the traditional HAZOP/LOPA analysis. This approach allows for a more complete evaluation of the engineering design and safe operation options. To illustrate this approach, an example is shown on the selection of appropriate engineering design options for cyclic regeneration of dense phase ethylene treaters due to their unique safety concerns. Using a combination of HAZOP scenario identification, LOPA, human factors task analysis and fault tree analysis, a cost effective design solution is developed to manage the unique risks associated with dense phase ethylene treater and regeneration systems. These techniques not only avoid the cost and complexity of implementing a SIL-3 instrumented safety system that are called for by HAZOP/LOPA, they also identify that the risks associated with routine opening of process equipment for blinding and un-blinding could be avoided as well.

Furthermore, the advent of smart glasses offers the possibility of not only analyzing visual information in front of the wearers but also behind them through an extended field of view. Although such visually available' information can enhance one's social interactions, the privacy and ethical implications for automated judgments about bystanders, especially from the perspective of PVIs, remains underexplored. To study the concerns of both bystanders and PVIs with such technologies, we conducted two online surveys with visually impaired participants as wearers (N = 128) and sighted participants as bystanders (N = 136). Although PVIs found some types of information to be improper or impolite (such as someone's weight), our overarching finding is the shared ethical concern between PVIs and bystanders related to the fallibility of AI, in which bystanders can be misrepresented (algorithmically) by the devices. These mischaracterizations can range from occasional unexpected algorithmic errors (e.g., errors in facial recognition) to the questionable use of AI for determining subjective social constructs (such as gender). Based on our findings, we discuss the design implications and directions for future work in the development of camera-based assistive technologies while mitigating the ethical concerns of PVIs and bystanders.},

abstract = {China's mountain tunnel project has made great achievements after more than 30 years of rapid development. However, the various accidents and risks accompanying the accomplishments remain severe. To date, the rapid development of risk assessment, management theory, and practicality have become indispensable parts of the construction process and contribute immensely to the safety of the staff, thereby reducing economic losses and protecting the natural environment in the tunnel construction. Risk assessment, management theory, and practicality have encountered many issues in the application process, such as the lack of a clear and complete risk management process and standardized risk assessment indicator system. To overcome these problems, a complete process for the risk assessment and management of a mountain tunnel construction by summarizing and promoting the risk assessment process of the existing standards has been established in this study. Moreover, the identification of risk factors in this process is elaborated upon with regard to risk source identification, risk event identification, and the relationship between them. The existing risk assessment index system was perfected by introducing soft science quantitative analysis methods, building an accident case database and practical software platform, adopting the methods that involve selecting indicators reasonably, introducing indicator weights, and normalizing a scoring standard. Thus, a complete construction safety risk assessment and management theory system for mountain tunnel construction was established. This study considered the overall risk assessment and rockburst risk assessment systems as examples to elaborate upon the ideas of the proposed assessment systems. Hence, the practical application of risk assessment and management theory in particular projects could be promoted. {\textcopyright} 2019, Editorial Board of Journal of Tianjin University(Science and Technology).

abstract = {Purpose: In this study, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach for evaluating airworthiness factors were presented. The purpose of this study is to develop an acceptable rationale for operational activities in civil and military aviation and for design, production and maintenance activities in the aviation industry that can be used in-flight safety programs and evaluations. Design/methodology/approach: In aviation, while the initial and continuing airworthiness of aircraft is related to technical airworthiness, identifying and minimizing risks for avoiding losses and damages are related to operational airworthiness. Thus, the airworthiness factors in civil and military aviation were evaluated under these two categories as the technical and operational airworthiness factors by the analytic hierarchy process and analytic network process. Three technical and five operational airworthiness criteria for civil aviation, three technical and nine operational airworthiness criteria for military aviation were defined, evaluated, prioritized and compared in terms of flight safety. Findings: The most important technical factor is the “airworthiness status of the aircraft” both in civil (81.9%) and military (77.6%) aviation, which means that aircraft should initially be designed for safety. The most significant operational factors are the “air traffic control system” in civil (30.9%) and “threat” in the military (26.6%) aviation. The differences within factor weights may stem from the design requirements and acceptable safety levels (frequency of occurrences 1 in 107 in military and 1 in 109 in civil aircraft design) of civil and military aircraft with the mission achievement requirements in civil and military aviation operations. The damage acceptance criteria for civil and military aircraft are different. The operation risks are accepted in the military and acceptance of specific tasks and the risk levels can vary with aircraft purpose and type. Practical implications: This study provides an acceptable rationale for safety programs and evaluations in aviation activities. The results of this study can be used in real-world airworthiness applications and safety management by the aviation industry and furthermore, critical factor weights should be considered both in civil and military aviation operations and flights. The safety levels of airlines with respect to our airworthiness factor weights or the safety level of military operations can be computed. Originality/value: This is the first study considering technical and operational airworthiness factors as an MCDM problem. Originality and value of this paper are defining critical airworthiness factors for civil and military aviation, ranking these factors, revealing the most important ones and using MCDM methods for the evaluations of airworthiness factors for the first time. In civil aviation flight safety is the basic tenet of airworthiness activities in risk analysis, on the other hand in military aviation high levels of risks are to be avoided in peace training or operational tasks. However, even high risks have to be accepted during the war, if the operational requirements impose, as mission achievement is vital. The paper is one of a kind on airworthiness evaluations for flight safety. {\textcopyright} 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The frequency of occurrence of an accident scenario is one of the key aspects to take into consideration in the field of risk assessment. Aspects such as the human factor, which is a major cause of undesired events in process industries, are usually not considered explicitly in the frequency estimation, mainly due to the uncertainty generated due to the lack of knowledge and the complexity associated to it. In this work, failure frequencies are modified by including the uncertainty generated by the human factor through the Monte Carlo simulation. This technique is one of the most commonly approaches used for uncertainty assessment and it is based on probability distribution functions that represent all the variables included in the model. The Monte Carlo simulation technique has been proved be very useful in the risk assessment field. The model takes into account the uncertainty and variability generated by several variables of the human factor such as the Organizational factor (Contracting, Training, Communication and Reporting), the Job Characteristics Factor (Workload Management, Environmental Conditions, Safety Equipment) and the Personal Characteristics Factor (Skills and Knowledge, Personal Behavior). As a first attempt to test the model, it has been applied to a real case study of a chemical plant, obtaining new frequency values for a selected scenario. Since the uncertainty generated by the human factor has now been taken in to account through Monte Carlo simulation, these new values are more realistic and accurate. As a result, an improvement of the final risk assessment is achieved.},

However, the use of this technology is very vulnerable to data breaches. Data breach incidents became a big topic in Indonesia during 2020 since the leaks of millions of users' personal data from some of the largest e-commerce sites. This incident should certainly be a warning to all organizations, especially in Jakarta Greater Area (Jabodetabek), Jakarta, Indonesia, to pay more attention to the security of their company's information. Most of organizations have prioritized a technology approach to protect their information assets from potential attacks. Some of the commonly used information security technologies are firewall devices, Antivirus software, IDS, etc. Although the prevention of attacks by technical means is important, the risk of insider threats must be taken into account, Users or employees tend to be the main factor in many information security breaches. This research aims to determine whether security education & training, information security awareness, employee relationships, employee accountability, organizational culture, and national culture have a significant effect on employee security behavior. The empirical analysis relies on a survey data from a cross section of employees from 10 companies in Jabodetabek and a structural equation modeling approach via SmartPLS 3. The results showed no direct and significant effect of security education & training on improving employee security behavior in Jabodetabek. The security education & training influences all mediators (information security awareness, employee relationship and employee accountability), and all the mediators influences employee behavior in using the company's information system. The most influential variable is employee accountability. Organizational culture and national culture influence employee behavior in using company information systems. {\textcopyright} 2022 Little Lion Scientific. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the accumulation of fatigue over a two-week offshore period. In particular, the effects of (1) time-of-day and days-on-shift as well as (2) acute and chronic sleep loss on the rate at which fatigue accumulates were investigated. Methods: 42 day-shift offshore workers were examined. Fatigue was measured using pre- and post-shift scores on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Total sleep time was measured using actigraphy (Motionwatch8, Camntech). Data was analyzed using a linear mixed model analyses. Results: Average sleep loss per night was 92 min (95%CI: 89.6–94.0; p <.001). Mean cumulative sleep loss across the study was 21:20hrs (SD = 08:10hrs) over the 14 days. Chronic sleep loss was significantly related to a modest increase in sleepiness (KSS) across the shift (95%CI: 0.01–0.17; p =.020) and in post-shift scores (95%CI:.07–0.19; p <.001). Time-of-day (95%CI: 0.63 to −0.01; p =.042) and days-on-shift (95%CI: 0.03–0.08; p <.001) as well as their interaction (95%CI: 0.08 to −0.00; p =.027) influenced the rate at which fatigue accumulated over a two-week offshore period. Conclusions: Pre- and post-shift fatigue accumulate in different ways over the two-week offshore period. The accumulation of post-shift fatigue scores was positively related to successive days-on-shift and chronic sleep loss. Our results suggest that prolonging offshore periods will likely result in elevated fatigue risk. Accumulating fatigue and sleep loss over two-week offshore periods should be considered in fatigue risk management plans and systems. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Despite the advances made so far in developing human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, many issues still exist. Most notable are; the lack of an explicit causal model that incorporates relevant psychological and cognitive theories in its core human performance model, inability to explicitly model interdependencies between influencing factors on human performance, lack of consistency, traceability and reproducibility in quantitative analysis and human error probability (HEP) estimation. These issues amongst others have contributed to the variability in results seen in the application of different HRA methods and in cases where the same method is applied by different analysts. In an attempt to address these issues, a framework for a "model-based HRA" methodology has been recently proposed which incorporates strong elements of current HRA good practices, leverages lessons learned from empirical studies and the best features of existing and emerging HRA methods. It is aimed at enabling more credible, consistent, and accurate qualitative and quantitative HRA analysis. This paper presents the step by step procedure guidelines required by an HRA analyst for conducting a comprehensive qualitative analysis using the model-based HRA methodology. When properly applied, these procedure guidelines should result in a qualitative analysis that is detailed, consistent, traceable, reproducible and properly documented. Therefore, it would aid in addressing the issue of variability seen within the field of HRA when the same method is applied by different analyst.},

Events obey that system-design did not anticipate effects of unforeseen conditions leading to lack of safety-functions of a system. However, there are methods obligatory to show that systems can perform safely and to ensure safety functioning in real life conditions, which need to be conducted for any technical system, i.e. predictive risk assessments. As accidents continue to happen, obviously accidents show also the incompleteness of such predictive risk assessments. This paper will provide a systematic for grouping the entire scope of human issues ranging from classical human reliability to errors of commission and will span up to resilience. From this general systematic, requirements for the safety culture and safety in the planning phase of a system development will be drawn, using a safety scanning approach. From this systematic, a logic of human reliability, assessments for current and future systems will be outlined, including how to assess the resilience of systems with respect to human reliability. The importance of event evaluations for modern human reliability management will be shown using examples for occupational health and safety issues. Finally, the paper will describe how predictive risk assessments can be improved regarding the human role on risk and accidents. It will describe the pitfalls and needs to better Human Reliability Assessment, including task- and goal-related human behavior in risk assessments. The paper concludes with an outline of the potential and use of big-data algorithms for Human Reliability Assessment for active system safety design and organizational human reliability Management.

abstract = {Despite the numerous breakthroughs in crash analytics, there remains a lack of consensus among safety practitioners as to the optimal method for locating high crash locations. Two critical components in the traffic safety analysis process not agreed upon are 1) how the crash distance to a target location is included in the analysis and 2) how crashes are weighted based on crash-related characteristics. For example, the commonly used buffering technique to determine which crashes are associated with a specific target road segment does not associate crashes that are closer to a target road segment with any additional weight, even though it is likely to be more greatly associated with the characteristics of the target location. Additionally, the commonly used equivalent property damage only (EPDO) crash weight method has been found to weigh fatal crashes significantly more than serious injury crashes, even if the difference between the two outcomes was a single factor. This study proposes more robust crash weighting techniques for use in high-risk location identification using an application of a novel horizontal curve dataset. Specifically, a heteroscedastic censored regression approach was used to investigate the impact of different crash proximity weighting techniques and crash severity weighting methods on model outcomes. The results demonstrate that the use of a linear distance weighting factor used in conjunction with the buffering technique as well as a less precise EPDO weighting factor method results in more robust safety analysis outcomes. The improved results have the potential to improve hot spot identification and resource allocation at both the federal and regional levels by employing models that more accurately link specific crash segments with contributing crash characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {One of the most effective attacks on cybersecurity is Social Engineering, in which the attacker deceives an end-user to steal its credentials and perpetrate cyber-crimes. There are hardware and software countermeasures to deal with these types of attacks. However, people themselves are the most vulnerable link in this security chain. In addition, there are influencing factors in people's behavior, which make them more vulnerable. This study aims to determine the most common characteristics that make users vulnerable, either individually or in groups. For this, we conduct an exploratory and descriptive study on administrative, lecturers, and students of a higher education institution on four scales that consider the following behaviors: risk behavior, conservative behavior, exposure to offense, and perception of risk. The results obtained show that users with risky behavior are the most exposed to a Social Engineering attack. We also concluded that the analyzed groups of lecturers and administrators are less likely to be victims of these attacks than students. Finally, we inferred that people who spend more time in front of a computer and are more permissive of risky behaviors are more vulnerable to these attacks. {\textcopyright} 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This study is significant because it contributes to understanding the complex human-machine environment. This study utilized the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) to classify the kinds of human factors errors involved in a particular subset of UAS accidents. The study researcher presented four UAS accident reports to a group of diversely experienced pilots. Each of these four accidents involved the same make and similar models of UAS. These UAS models are acutely prone to human-machine interactive failures because their designs are distinctly different than are normally present in human-occupied aircraft. The researcher then subjected the HFACS analyses results to a safety risk analysis involving several qualitative analytical methods. The study results showed that 8 of the 19 (42%) HFACS categories overwhelmingly contributed to 77% of the total risk in the aggregate of the four UAS accidents under study, while another 6 of the 19 (32%) HFACS categories contributed to less than 5% of the total risk. {\textcopyright} 2016 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

abstract = {At present, aircraft accidents caused by human factors occur frequently. As the flight crew is the last line of defense for aviation safety, how to identify and quantitatively evaluate human errors in flight and reduce the error rate has become an important issue for the civil aviation, and it is also the most effective way to control flight operation risks. Thus, the human error mechanism for pilot was investigated by the combine of the fault tree and the Bayesian network theories based on historical research data of typical unsafe events caused by flight human errors. Firstly, the fault tree was used to identify and qualitatively analyze the risk of systems, and then transformed into a Bayesian network model to obtain the relative probability of intermediate events and top events. Finally, the system hierarchy of unsafe events caused by flight human error was quantitatively evaluated. The results showed that there were 96 failure modes in the system, and the flight human error was caused by the coupling of multiple risk factors. The probability of non-technical skill loss is the highest, followed by that of the lack of technical skills and violations. The basic events in the organization, environment and equipment factors have a great impact on the flight human error, which is a weak link in the system. The results provide some theoretical basis for developing preventive measures of flight human error and improving the level of flight safety. {\textcopyright} 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

We found that many non-users did not see the utility of smart speakers or did not trust speaker companies. In contrast, users express few privacy concerns, but their rationalizations indicate an incomplete understanding of privacy risks, a complicated trust relationship with speaker companies, and a reliance on the socio-technical context in which smart speakers reside. Users trade privacy for convenience with different levels of deliberation and privacy resignation. Privacy tensions arise between primary, secondary, and incidental users of smart speakers. Finally, current smart speaker privacy controls are rarely used, as they are not well-aligned with users' needs.

This paper first reviews one of the most widely used healthcare human factors systems models, the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model, and then introduces an extended model, 'SEIPS 2.0'. SEIPS 2.0 incorporates three novel concepts into the original model: configuration, engagement and adaptation. The concept of configuration highlights the dynamic, hierarchical and interactive properties of sociotechnical systems, making it possible to depict how health-related performance is shaped at 'a moment in time'. Engagement conveys that various individuals and teams can perform health-related activities separately and collaboratively. Engaged individuals often include patients, family caregivers and other non-professionals. Adaptation is introduced as a feedback mechanism that explains how dynamic systems evolve in planned and unplanned ways. Key implications and future directions for human factors research in healthcare are discussed. Practitioner Summary: SEIPS 2.0 is a new human factors/ergonomics framework for studying and improving health and healthcare. It describes how sociotechnical systems shape health-related work done by professionals and non-professionals, independently and collaboratively. Work processes, in turn, shape patient, professional and organisational outcomes. Work systems and processes undergo planned and unplanned adaptations.},

These standards focus on different aspects of the systems, while generally failing to provide support for holistic analyses - a key aspect in ensuring a secure IT infrastructure. This work aims to address this gap by presenting a new methodology for evaluating the overall security risks of a networked system that adopts an ontology-based approach we presented in previous work. We leverage current security standards and databases, while also considering the human factors to build a broader and interconnected view. Our methodology is meant to achieve a more realistic picture of the network security, hence improving situation awareness for its administrators.

abstract = {Nowadays, the digital transformation of organizations is not a challenge but a must-have. In the spring of 2020, practically the whole world worked from home offices. Now digital adaptation is the challenge for many people and orgaization. This situation poses challenges for the cybersecurity world. At the time of writing this article, there is no exact data yet on what cybersecurity incidents have occurred or how much damage they have caused. Nevertheless, it is certain that in the pandemic chaos, many corporates made mistakes during their digital adaptation processes. To a considerable extent, these mistakes are due to humans. Even though there are outstanding technological solutions or regulations at a company, if this riskfactor is not appropriately managed, then the other two are worthless. Despite the need, there is no widespread human risk anylisys method in cybersecurity, because it is difficult to measure, and covered in obscurity. In this paper, the authors propose a fuzzy model to organizations whereby they can measure this risk if they have sufficient information about the workforce. The model will be easier understood if presented through a specific threat, the digital leakage of classified information from a critical infrastructure.  {\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity threats are on the rise with evermore digitization of the information that many day-to-day systems depend upon. The demand for cybersecurity analysts outpaces supply, which calls for optimal management of the analyst resource. Therefore, a key component of the cybersecurity defense system is the optimal scheduling of its analysts. Sensor data is analyzed by automatic processing systems, and alerts are generated. A portion of these alerts is considered to be significant, which requires thorough examination by a cybersecurity analyst. Risk, in this article, is defined as the percentage of unanalyzed or not thoroughly analyzed alerts among the significant alerts by analysts. The article presents a generalized optimization model for scheduling cybersecurity analysts to minimize risk (a.k.a., maximize significant alert coverage by analysts) and maintain risk under a pre-determined upper bound. The article tests the optimization model and its scalability on a set of given sensors with varying analyst experiences, alert generation rates, system constraints, and system requirements. Results indicate that the optimization model is scalable and is capable of identifying both the right mix of analyst expertise in an organization and the sensor-to-analyst allocation in order to maintain risk below a given upper bound. Several meta-principles are presented, which are derived from the optimization model, and they further serve as guiding principles for hiring and scheduling cybersecurity analysts. The simulation studies (validation) of the optimization model outputs indicate that risk varies non-linearly with an analyst/sensor ratio, and for a given analyst/sensor ratio, the risk is independent of the number of sensors in the system.},

abstract = {Diverse researches following the advancement of IT technology and emergence of smart devices are common in current research. In particular, the most commercialized smart device, the smart phone, provides convenient communication among users due to easy portability and real-time information sharing within a diverse system. Moreover, spatial and temporal use of smart devices greatly increased because these devices are capable of performing the same functions as a desktop personal computer, making smart phones extremely popular. However, research on smart phones has mainly focused on the convenience of the services offered on these devices, while the issue of security has been neglected. Smart phones are vulnerable to diverse, malicious attacks, which have increased as new functions are developed and commonly used. For this reason, a number of applications were developed to detect a variety of malicious codes in smart phones and prevent private information leakage. However, due to the difficulties of recognizing and responding to attacks, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs), an intelligent security model is urgently required. This paper suggests intelligent security model of smart phone based on human behavior in mobile cloud computing to detect diverse types of malicious code in smart phones and respond to advanced attacks, such as APTs. The suggested intelligent security model of smart phone securely protects users from private information leaks and illegal billing action. Moreover, intelligent response to malicious, difficult-to-detect code is provided by a user behavior-based intelligent analysis, which makes it possible to shut down network, registry, drive, and system accessibility and to notify users to respond to malicious attacks. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Moodle is an open-source Learning Management System (LMS) that is used widely around the world. Moodle is the most popular and most used learning management system because of its flexibility and open source. There are more than 68 millions Moodle users and more than 55, 000 Moodle systems are used with different purposes around the world. The vast numbers of Moodle user is due to the user friendliness of the system that caters the needs of learning and training for all people from any institutes or organizations. This study is conducted to prevent information security threats especially information integrity threats that happen in Olympia College Moodle. To achieve the goal of this study, there are two objectives that have been indentified, which is to scrutinize learning materials handling procedures that are currently implemented by Olympia College and the effects of those procedures towards information integrity in the Moodle. At the same time, this study also proposes some mitigation measures which can be implemented to ensure the information integrity threats in Olympia College Moodle can be detered. The study is conducted through grouped interviews, analysis of related documents, observations and online surveys to lecturers and students of Olympia College to gain information on the problems that are faced by them when using or accessing Moodle. The analysis of this study shows that human factors and the shortcomings of the learning materials handling procedures implemented by Olympia College trigger the information security threats on the learning materials that can be found on Moodle. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {An analysis of the recent major security incidents related to industrial control systems, revealed thatmost had been caused by company employees. Therefore, enterprise security management systems have been developed to focus on companies' personnel. Nonetheless, several hacking incidents, involving major companies and public/financial institutions, were actually attempted by the cooperative firms or the outsourced manpower undertaking maintenance work. Specifically, institutions that operate industrial control systems (ICSs) associated with critical national infrastructures, such as traffic or energy, have contracted several cooperative firms. Nonetheless, ICT's importance is gradually increasing, due to outsourcing, and is themost vulnerable factor in security. This paper proposes a virtualized security management scheme for the resident cooperative firms in the industrial control infrastructure. Since such companies often cannot afford adequate investment in security, the scheme is to let an ICS company provide the virtualized system. One of its merits is the convenience of controlling a VDI server at the center. The cooperative firms were classified, based on their respective security levels, and statisticswere collected throughout a four-year period for the results. This paper analyzes the policies and virtualization systems that have been applied to the security of the partner companies, which engaged in ICS security. A suitable model for ICS security was then proposed by analyzing their effects on the system efficiencies, based on the comparisons of the security inspection results obtained before and after virtualization. The proposed system is expected to contribute to industrial safety. {\textcopyright} 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

However, there are no studies comparing these users' privacy and safety concerns and protective strategies online with those reported by non-autistic teenagers. Furthermore, researchers have yet to identify possible explanations for autistic teenagers' increased risk of online harms. To address these research gaps, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 autistic and 16 non-autistic teenagers assessing their privacy- and safety-related attitudes and behaviors on SNS, and factors affecting them. We used videos demonstrating relevant SNS scenarios as prompts to engage participants in conversation. Through our thematic analyses, we found evidence that autistic teenagers may be more averse to taking risks on SNS than non-autistic teenagers. Yet, several personal, social, and SNS design factors may make autistic teenagers more vulnerable to cyberbullying and social exclusion online. We provide recommendations for making SNS safer for autistic teenagers. Our research highlights the need for more inclusive usable privacy and security research with this population.},

In BIBIFI, teams build specified software with the goal of maximizing correctness, performance, and security. The latter is tested when teams attempt to break other teams' submissions. Winners are chosen from among the best builders and the best breakers. BIBIFI was designed to be open-ended - teams can use any language, tool, process, and so on, that they like. As such, contest outcomes shed light on factors that correlate with successfully building secure software and breaking insecure software. We ran three contests involving a total of 156 teams and three different programming problems. Quantitative analysis from these contests found that the most efficient build-it submissions used C/C++, but submissions coded in a statically type safe language were 11× less likely to have a security flaw than C/C++ submissions. Break-it teams that were also successful build-it teams were significantly better at finding security bugs.},

One method to comply with the requirements includes aircraft certification testing of systems - which are usually associated with long time frames and high costs. Besides, they usually demand specialized technical devices and skilled manpower. The use of analogous models to a system might reduce several steps and costs of such test procedures. These models might also contain important information about the tested system to be explored in a risk analysis. This work demonstrates how the parameters of an electrical circuit analogous to a landing gear system on a free drop test can be used as research tools to start a risk analysis based on human factors. The results can be easily grouped and tabulated, allowing us to demonstrate the versatility of the method presented herein and to conclude that this analysis can be expanded into a new area of research on systems' safety. {\textcopyright} 2013 Brazilian Society for Automatics - SBA.},

The SSH system is an inexpensive, non-intrusive, non-invasive, and non-vision-based system, which consists of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and dry EEG electrodes. A haptic device, such as vibrotactile motor, is integrated to the helmet in order to alert the operator when computed risk level (fatigue, high stress or error) reaches a threshold.

abstract = {New safety critical systems are about to appear in our everyday life: advanced robots able to interact with humans and perform tasks at home, in hospitals, or at work. A hazardous behavior of those systems, induced by failures or extreme environment conditions, may lead to catastrophic consequences. Well-known risk analysis methods used in other critical domains (e.g., avionics, nuclear, medical, transportation), have to be extended or adapted due to the non-deterministic behavior of those systems, evolving in unstructured environments. One major challenge is thus to develop methods that can be applied at the very beginning of the development process, to identify hazards induced by robot tasks and their interactions with humans. In this paper we present a method which is based on an adaptation of a hazard identification technique, HAZOP (Hazard Operability), coupled with a system description notation, UML (Unified Modeling Language). This systematic approach has been applied successfully in research projects, and is now applied by robot manufacturers. Some results of those studies are presented and discussed to explain the benefits and limits of our method. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Aiming at the characteristics of uncertainty, dynamics and fuzziness for engineering construction in navigable waters and the problems including incomplete risk index system, the risk-classification-quantification-standard unsuitable for real-time dynamic risk evaluation, and the empirical judgment for the current construction risk assessment, a general three-level safety risk index system was established based on the mutual influence and subordination of risk factors including the effect of human-related, equipment and environment factors. Taking the dredging project of a large trailing suction dredger as an example, the three-level quantitative standard of risk classification was established from the integration of objective evaluation mechanisms and subjective evaluation mechanisms, and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method was used to set up a comprehensive multifactor construction safety risk evaluation model. Finally the model was applied to the eighth phase of the Hengsha Dongtan silt promotion ring project successfully. The model of construction safety risk assessment coupled with multiple factors will provide effective reference and guidance for real-time dynamic construction risk assessment and control in navigable waters. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Shennongjia is one of the most important ecological function areas and ecologically vulnerable zones in the world. With the rapid development of social economies, especially tourism, the ecological environment of Shennongjia has experienced profound changes. Exploring the characteristics and changing trends of ecological environment in Shennongjia will help to analyze the causes of the damage to the ecological environment, and build a vulnerability analysis framework with multi-scale, multi-element, multi-flow, and multi-circulation characteristics, which provides an effective research paradigm and analysis tool for the study of regional ecological vulnerability. With the support of RS and GIS technology, this study uses spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) and the vulnerability scoring diagram (VSD) model to comprehensively and quantitatively analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and driving forces of ecological vulnerability in Shennongjia from 1996 to 2018. The VSD model was selected to decompose the vulnerability into three components of "exposure-sensitivity-adaptation", and 16 indicators were selected to construct an ecological vulnerability evaluation system in Shennongjia, and the evaluation data were organized in a progressive and detailed way. (1) During the study period, the overall ecological vulnerability of Shennongjia is in a mild vulnerability level, exhibiting differentiation characteristics of high in the northeast and low in the southwest. High vulnerability zones are mainly distributed in the main towns and roads. (2) The risk of ecological vulnerability of the entire region presents the characteristics of continuous decline. (3) Land-use types, population density, and vegetation coverage are the main factors driving the evolution of ecological vulnerability. (4) A high level of coupling coordination exists between ecological vulnerability and landscape patterns. Analyses of the ecological vulnerability of Shennongjia shows that the entire region is in a mild vulnerability level. The extreme vulnerability risk of the ecological environment shows polarization. The evolution of ecological environment in Shennongjia is the result of the interaction between human activities and natural environment. This study offers an effective way to assess ecological vulnerability and provides some strategies and guidance for improving ecological security. {\textcopyright} 2022, The Author(s).},

In some countries, accidents at LC account for up to 50% of railway accidents. In this paper, we conduct a risk assessment comparative study involving two main types of Automatic Protection Systems (APSs), the first using a pair of half-barriers and the second with four half-barriers. So far, the choice of such LC protection systems has been exclusively done on the basis of qualitative expertise. The study we carry out here is based on some parameterizable behavioral models we have developed, which describe the global dynamics within the LC area. In contrast to existing studies on LC safety, our models take into account not only railway and road traffic but also the risk due to human factors while focusing on two major risky situations. The simulation results clearly show the potential risk with each of the investigated APSs, according to various features of the dynamics within the LC area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work dealing with a quantitative comparison between different types of LCs. The developed models can be easily accommodated in order to describe existing infrastructures. {\textcopyright} 2000-2011 IEEE.},

Thus, they represent a serious threat to all businesses in general, but are especially troublesome for e-commerce, travel, and financial services.

To this end, this work provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field of CAPTCHA schemes and defines a new classification that includes all the emerging schemes. In addition, for each identified CAPTCHA category, the most successful attack methods are summarized by also describing how CAPTCHA schemes evolved to resist bot attacks, and discussing the limitations of different CAPTCHA schemes from the security, usability, and compatibility point of view. Finally, an assessment of the open issues, challenges, and opportunities for further study is provided, paving the road toward the design of the next-generation secure and user-friendly CAPTCHA schemes.},

In any complex socio-technical system, human behaviour can disrupt the secure and efficient running of the system with risk accumulating through individual and system-wide errors and compromised security behaviours that may be exploited by actors with malicious intent. Practitioners' experience and use of different assessment methods and approaches to establish cyber-security vulnerabilities and risk are evaluated. Qualitative and quantitative methods and data are used for different stages of investigations in order to derive risk assessments and access contextual experience for further analyses. Organisational security culture and development approaches along with safety assessment methods are discussed in this case study to understand how well the people, the system, and the organisation interact. Cyber-security Human Factors practice draws on other application areas such as safety, usability, behaviours and culture to progressively assess security posture; the benefits of each approach are discussed.

abstract = {Human errors exploitation could entail unfavorable consequences to smart device users. Typically, smart devices provide multiple configurable features, e.g., user authentication settings, network selection, application installation, communication interfaces, etc., which users can configure according to their need and convenience. However, untrustworthy features configuration could mount severe risks towards the protection and integrity of data and assets residing on smart devices or to perform security-sensitive activities on smart devices. Conventional security mechanisms mainly focus on preventing and monitoring malware, but they do not perform the runtime vulnerabilities assessment while users use their smart devices. In this paper, we propose a risk-driven model that determines features reliability at runtime by monitoring users' features usage patterns. The resource access permissions (e.g., ACCESS_INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE) given to an application requiring higher security are revoked in case users configure less reliable features (e.g., open WIFI or HOTSPOT) on their smart devices. Thus, our model dynamically fulfills the security criteria of the security-sensitive applications and revokes resources access permission given to them, until features reliability is set to a secure level. Consequently, smart devices are secured against any runtime vulnerabilities that may surface due to human factors. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {During a ship life cycle, one of the most critical phases in terms of safety refers to harbor maneuvers, which take place in restricted and congested waters, leading to higher collision and grounding risks in comparison to open sea navigation. In this scenario, a single accident may stop the harbor's traffic as well as incur into patrimonial damage, environmental pollution, human casualties and reputation losses. In order to support the vessel's captain during the maneuver, local experienced maritime pilots stay on board coordinating the ship navigation while in restricted waters. Because of their shorter relative duration, harbor maneuvers accidents are more probable to occur due to human errors - reinforced by the inherent surrounding difficulties -, rather than machinery failures, for instance. The human errors are object of study of the human reliability analysis (HRA). Aiming to assess the main factors contributing to human errors in pilot-assisted harbor ship maneuvers, this work proposes a Bayesian network model for HRA, supported by a prospective human performance model for quantification. Similar works focus mainly on open sea navigation and collision accidents, which do not reflect the strict conditions found on port areas. Additionally, most of the models are highly dependent on expert's opinion for quantification. Therefore, the novelty of this work resides into two aspects: a) incorporation of harbor specific conditions for maritime navigation HRA, including the performance of ship's crew and maritime pilots; and b) the use of a prospective human performance model as an alternative to expert's opinion for quantification purposes. To illustrate the usage of the proposed methodology, this paper presents an analysis of the route keeping task along waterways, starting from the quantification of human error probabilities (HEP) and including the ranking of the main external factors that contribute to the HEP.

abstract = {Benefiting from the rapid development of communication and intelligent vehicle technology in recent years, most traffic information is capable of being collected, processed, and transmitted to each vehicle through a connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) system. To meet the higher requirements of driving safety in CAVs environment, it is necessary to develop more effective safety evaluation indicators that combine all the traffic information received by the vehicle. To this end, this study proposes a novel methodology for risk perception and warning strategy based on safety potential field model to minimize driving risk in the CAVs environment. A dynamic safety potential field model was constructed to describe the spatial distribution of driving risk encountered by vehicles. This safety potential field model can comprehensively consider the impact of various types of traffic information on driving risk. And then, a novel driving risk indicator, named potential field indicator (PFI), was established to evaluate the level of driving risk. Finally, an early warning strategy was proposed to prevent accidents, whose performance was evaluated by several simulations carried out through SUMO simulator. The comparison with some classic risk indicators indicate that our proposed PFI can more accurately reflect the actual driving risk faced by vehicles under different vehicle motion states and thus is more suitable for driving risk assessment in the CAVs environment. It is expected that the findings in this study could be valuable in improving the performance of strategic decision-making in driver assistance systems in the CAVs environment. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The main purpose of this analysis is to provide guidelines for the HOF analysis and its quantification for accident risk assessment in chemical process industries. In this analysis both operational and diagnostic layers are considered with respect to human actions. For the purpose of this analysis, five identified organizational factors have been selected as Performance Shaping Factors (PSF) for human actions/interventions. The SPAR- H model has been applied to evaluate the affect of PSFs on the human reliability. The overall framework has been modeled by using a newly developed approach, the Method for Error Deduction and Incident Analysis (MEDIA). In MEDIA new HOF action- based taxonomies have also been developed. By using a score method it is possible to identify the most critical PSF for human reliability, which should be improved in order to improve the overall human reliability.

abstract = {Introduction: Construction sites exhibit unique hazardous characteristics. Hence, investigating the causes of fatal and nonfatal accidents is extremely important to promote safety on construction sites. Literature shows a risk perception (RP) scale for construction workers; to expand the existing research, this study aims to identify risky scenarios for assessing the RP of Thai construction workers, with the goal of reducing workplace incidents. Method: The scale development process consists of four phases. Item development was also performed, followed by factor analysis. Reliability and validity assessments were finalized in the process. A survey of 500 construction workers in Thailand was conducted to investigate risky scenarios. Through the process, a total of 17 items remained in the final RP scale, and the reliability and validity of these items were confirmed. Results: The RP scale was affirmed to have four dimensions (probability, severity, worry, and unsafe). These dimensions of workers' RP were negatively correlated with the workers' risk-taking behaviors. This study further showed that participants with a high level of affective RP were more likely to have a high level of cognitive RP. Hence, those with a high level of RP tended to be involved in fewer risk-taking behaviors. Practical Applications: The final version of the scale was reliable and valid in determining the RP and risk-taking behaviors of construction workers in Thailand. {\textcopyright} 2021 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The calibration process of any health critical equipment is very important from the perspective of patient care. However, the calibration process is prone to human errors. A systematic and easy to implement methodology for detection and mitigation of the same is essential for any sustainable healthcare program. In this study, the entire calibration procedure is divided into sub-processes and the different modes of errors were identified. Expert opinions are collected for risk quantification. This assessment shows an overview of the calibration steps, along with the different modes of failures associated with the process. Then a failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) based risk assessment is used to prioritize the failure modes followed by their identification and mitigation measures. The risk priority number (RPN) computed from the FMEA ranks the risks in the order of their priority. The methodology is demonstrated through calibration of a mechanical ventilator, and the results are presented. This framework can detect avoidable sources of errors, thereby increasing the reliability of critical patient care systems.  {\textcopyright} 2021 IEEE.},

Researchers have responded with a number of anti-phishing systems, based either on blacklists or on heuristics. The former cannot cope with the churn of phishing sites, while the latter usually employ decision rules that are not congruent to human perception. We propose a novel heuristic anti-phishing system that explicitly employs gestalt and decision theory concepts to model perceptual similarity. Our system is evaluated on three corpora contrasting legitimate Web sites with real-world phishing scams. The proposed system's performance was equal or superior to current best-of-breed systems. We further analyze current anti-phishing warnings from the perspective of warning theory, and propose a new warning design employing our Gestalt approach. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {In the aviation sector, human factors are the primary cause of safety incidents. Intelligent prediction systems, which are capable of evaluating human state and managing risk, have been developed over the years to identify and prevent human factors. However, the lack of large useful labelled data has often been a drawback to the development of these systems. This study presents a methodology to identify and classify human factor categories from aviation incident reports. For feature extraction, a text pre-processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline is developed. For data modelling, semi-supervised Label Spreading (LS) and supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques are considered. Random search and Bayesian optimization methods are applied for hyper-parameter analysis and the improvement of model performance, as measured by the Micro F1 score. The best predictive models achieved a Micro F1 score of 0.900, 0.779, and 0.875, for each level of the taxonomic framework, respectively. The results of the proposed method indicate that favourable predicting performances can be achieved for the classification of human factors based on text data. Notwithstanding, a larger data set would be recommended in future research. {\textcopyright} 2021 by the authors.},

abstract = {The success (or failure) of malware attacks depends upon both technological and human factors. The most security-conscious users are susceptible to unknown vulnerabilities, and even the best security mechanisms can be circumvented as a result of user actions. Although there has been significant research on the technical aspects of malware attacks and defence, there has been much less research on how users interact with both malware and current malware defences. This article describes a field study designed to examine the interactions between users, antivirus (AV) software, and malware as they occur on deployed systems. In a fashion similar to medical studies that evaluate the efficacy of a particular treatment, our experiment aimed to assess the performance of AV software and the human risk factors of malware attacks. The 4-month study involved 50 home users who agreed to use laptops that were instrumented to monitor for possible malware attacks and gather data on user behaviour. This study provided some very interesting, non-intuitive insights into the efficacy of AV software and human risk factors. AV performance was found to be lower under real-life conditions compared to tests conducted in controlled conditions. Moreover, computer expertise, volume of network usage, and peer-to-peer activity were found to be significant correlates of malware attacks. We assert that this work shows the viability and the merits of evaluating security products, techniques, and strategies to protect systems through long-term field studies with greater ecological validity than can be achieved through other means. {\textcopyright} 2018 ACM},

abstract = {Previous research on logistics financial risk pre-warning and pre-control focuses on the linear causal relationship between risk and risk events. In fact, risk events in logistics financial field are often caused by multiple risk factors, which are directly or indirectly related to these risk factors. Therefore, it is helpful for the healthy development of logistics finance to find out the related risks of each logistics financial risk event and screen and control them one by one. This paper proposes OntoLFR (Logistics Financial Risk Ontology), and constructs the logistics financial risk ontology model to adapt to the variability, complexity and relevance of risk in early warning and pre-control. Then, based on the risk source association inference rules obtained by knowledge association analysis, Apriori algorithm is adopted to conduct association analysis on the risk hidden danger database, and the acquired association rules are reintroduced into the knowledge ontology database of risk event source to realize self-learning and self-correction of the knowledge ontology database. Taking the risk event (RW_risk) of the financing enterprise to escape, the feasibility of using the logistics financial risk ontology model for risk-related reasoning and analysis is verified. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {This paper will present a practical application of a design process for developing and implementing effective process safety management (PSM) systems. Management system deficiencies are often the root causes leading to process safety incidents. Such deficiencies can be attributed to inadequately designed management systems, primarily since standards and regulations do not provide detailed specifications for their design. A methodology based on proven quality management principles will demonstrate how human factors can be incorporated directly into the design specification for a PSM system to assure effectiveness and deliver sustainable risk reduction performance. As such, they can have a dramatic impact on how individual management processes can be used to ensure that design, operational and maintenance activities are conducted in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. Applicable to both onshore and offshore facilities, this design methodology takes process safety beyond regulatory compliance and enables organizations to sustain performance for managing risk, reliability and resilience as part of an integrated operational risk management framework. It applies to both new and modified designs for engineered process systems, as well as individual management processes. Application of human factors to the management system design also allows for continual improvement in response to changes to regulations, technology, and operating practices. This paper will present a practical step-by-step procedure on "how to" incorporate human factors into the PSM system design, including: leadership, safety culture, human factors engineering and human-machine interfaces, employee engagement and empowerment, communications, etc. Examples will show how quality aspects for human factors are addressed in key management processes within the PSM system in order to improve risk reduction performance.},

State-of-the-art methods in cryptography have the potential to offer improved security of medical records; nonetheless, healthcare providers may be reluctant to adopt and implement them. The objectives of this study were to assess current data management and security procedures; to identify attitudes, knowledge, perceived norms, and self-efficacy regarding the adoption of advanced cryptographic techniques; and to offer guidelines that could help policy-makers and data security professionals work together to ensure that patient data are both secure and accessible. Methods: We conducted 12 in-depth semi-structured interviews with managers and individuals in key cybersecurity positions within Israeli healthcare organizations. The interviews assessed perceptions of the feasibility and benefits of adopting advanced cryptographic techniques for enhancing data security. Qualitative data analysis was performed using thematic network mapping. Results: Key data security personnel did not perceive advanced cybersecurity technologies to be a high priority for funding or adoption within their organizations. We identified three major barriers to the adoption of advanced cryptographic technologies for information security: barriers associated with regulators; barriers associated with healthcare providers; and barriers associated with the vendors that develop cybersecurity systems. Conclusions: We suggest guidelines that may enhance patient data security within the healthcare system and reduce the risk of future data breaches by facilitating cross-sectoral collaboration within the healthcare ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2022 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.},

abstract = {Recently, the melting of Arctic sea ice and development of maritime technology are enabling the regular voyages in Arctic waters. However, the Arctic maritime transportation system (AMTS) is a complex and dynamic system with respect to human, technical, environmental and organizational issues. For example, ships operating in Arctic waters suffer severe weather conditions, fully and partially ice-covered waters, and are also difficult to search and rescue in ice-covered Arctic waters due to remoteness from lands. These risk factors will influence the safety and security of ships operating in Arctic waters. For this, this paper identifies potential risk influencing factors (RIFs) for the AMTS from human, technical (ship), environmental and organizational aspects. An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method is used to analyze the hierarchical relationships and calculate the relative importance of the selected RIFs. Due to the complexity and uncertainty involved in the comprehensive analysis of RIFs for the AMTS, fuzzy sets are incorporated into AHP analysis to represent and treat the epistemic uncertainty. The identified critical RIFs in this study can be used to propose specific guidance for the operations of crews on board, ship owners, and ship managers. {\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract = {During a review of the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) safety basis at the Idaho National Laboratory, human factors analysts identified ergonomic and human reliability risks involving manual fuel handling in the ATR canal. An initial human reliability scoping study identified risks involving the inadvertent exposure of a fuel element to the air during manual fuel movement and inspection. There were clear indications that these risks increased the probability of human error and possible severe physical outcomes to the operator. In response to this concern, a detailed study was conducted to determine the probability of the inadvertent exposure of a fuel element. This study refined the previous HRA scoping analysis by determining the probability of the human failure event. The HRA analysis employed the SPARH method and was supplemented by information gained from a detailed analysis of the fuel inspection and transfer tasks. This latter analysis included ergonomics, work cycles, task duration, and workload imposed by tool and workplace characteristics, personal protective clothing, and operational practices that have the potential to increase physical and mental workload. Part of this analysis consisted of NASA-TLX analyses, combined with computational human performance analysis and 3D graphical modeling to determine task failures and precursors to such failures that have safety implications. The application of multiple analysis techniques in support of HRA methods in this project helped to produce sufficient information to indicate that the postulated fuel exposure accident was less than credible.},

This study uses telematics and in-vehicle monitoring features to examine the key factors underlying large commercial truck crashes, and quantifies the effect of these factors on crash risk. Data from 2,185 trucks in Shanghai, China, were collected for a total of 105,786 trips and 465,555 in-vehicle warnings to investigate three types of factors affecting risk: travel characteristics, driving behavior, and in-vehicle warnings. A zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model was built, and a ZIP model without the warning variables as well as a basic Poisson model with warnings were considered for comparison. It was found that the ZIP model considering in-vehicle warning information performed significantly better than the other models. The standardized regression coefficient method was used to identify the most important variables. In-vehicle yawn and smoking warnings had significantly more association with the number of crashes than did the travel characteristics and driving behavior variables, though freeway distance traveled, average freeway speed, percentage of trips on sunny days, and percentage of trips at night also correlated significantly with crash risk. These results can provide a reference for UBI insurance professionals considering in-vehicle active safety management, as well as support freight companies in drafting appropriate working regulations. {\textcopyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {To guarantee the safety and security of a real-time mobile system such as an intelligent transportation system, it is necessary to model and analyze its behaviors prior to actual development. In particular, the mobile objects in such systems must be isolated from each other so that they do not collide with each other. Since isolation means two or more mobile objects must not be located in the same place at the same time, a scheduling policy is required to control and coordinate the movement of such objects. However, traditional scheduling theories are based on task scheduling which is coarse-grained and cannot be directly used for fine-grained isolation controls. In this article, we first propose a fine-grained event-based formal model called a time dependency structure and use it to model and analyze real-time mobile systems. Next, an event-based schedule is defined and the composition of schedules is discussed. Then, we investigate the schedulability of isolation - that is, checking whether a given schedule ensures the isolation relationship among mobile objects or not. After that, we present an automation approach for scheduling generation to guarantee isolation controls in real-time mobile systems. Finally, case studies and simulation experiments demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Human error plays an important role triggering ship tragedies. Human error assessment of marine accidents is troublesome due to the lack or incompleteness of data. Some studies generate results in a form of priority weights rather than a probabilistic nature. Others produce Human Error Probabilities (HEPs) without the consideration of quantitative effects caused by the individual, technological, contextual and organizational factors or using the human performance data from nuclear power plants. This paper proposes a risk study evaluating the human error contribution to oil tanker grounding. A group of 6 experts with substantial seagoing experience is invited to provide professional judgement for oil tanker navigation. This research establishes a logical safety structure of oil tanker grounding based on Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) under which a novel fuzzy Cognitive Reliability Error Analysis Method (CREAM) model is constructed. By virtue of Bayesian Reasoning, the parameter synthesis process fully deliberates all useful information from each rule and derives reasonable outcomes. This study reinforces the logicality between Common Performance Conditions (CPC) observations and Contextual Control Mode (COCOM). The probability of ship powered grounding is acquired accordingly. Furthermore, fatigue and Collision Regulation (COLREG) violations are the vital elements triggering ship groundings according to the sensitivity analysis. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Investigating the relationships between self-reported driving behavior and psychology and observed risky driving behavior from in-vehicle trajectory data can provide better understanding of personal factors contributing to risky driving, allowing the more effective development of safety education and road management countermeasures and interventions. This paper analyzed GPS trajectory obtained from 723 professional online car-hailing drivers. Through road type matching, risky driving feature extraction and clustering analysis, each driver was given a risky driving level. The level was then compared with their self-reported driving behavior, psychology statues such as anxiety and driving anger, as well as social factors including safety culture, occupation health, and number of complaints. Results show that social factors are more relative to driver's risk driving level than other self-reported factors.

This article presents a set of metrics for this use case, driven by a four-stage cyclical interaction flow: (1) robot self-assessment of proficiency (RSA), (2) robot communication of proficiency to the human (RCP), (3) human understanding of proficiency (HUP), and (4) robot perception of the human's intentions, values, and assessments (RPH). This effort leverages work from related fields including explainability, transparency, and introspection, by repurposing metrics under the context of proficiency self-assessment. Considerations for temporal level (a priori, in situ, and post hoc) on the metrics are reviewed, as are the connections between metrics within or across stages in the proficiency-based interaction flow.

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to realize a micro-economic study of road accidents in Tunisia. Indeed, we opted a multinomial logit model to analyze the severity levels of road accidents at intersections. This severity, in the light of the road traffic safety literature, essentially depends mainly on three factors (human, vehicle, environment) relating to the road traffic system, as well as, road safety. These factors interact with space and time to provide an explanation of the occurrence and severity of an accident. This involves identifying and measuring several qualitative and quantitative variables to describe the different components. Therefore, this work aims to highlight the way and extent through which these explanatory variables affect the severity of a traffic accident. It's a question of estimating the probability that a driver is the victim of an accident of certain gravity, through the analysis of both his personal characteristic as well as those of the traffic environment. The results obtained confirm the effects of the factors mentioned on the severity of an accident and show that all the variables selected are theoretically and statistically significant and explanatory at different degrees.  {\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE.},

The introduction of the Occupational Safety and Health Act in 1994 by the Malaysian government made all industries in Malaysia to identify risks, conduct risk assessment and control risk. In addition, the Malaysian construction industry simultaneously implemented an integrated system to ensure consistency and better performance of projects. To identify the factors influencing contractors' risk attitudes, relevant literature was reviewed, and a questionnaire survey was conducted. This study focused on the G7 contractors operating in the Malaysian construction industry. One hundred and nineteen copies of a structured questionnaire were analysed with a response rate of 85%.

abstract = {Introduction: Previous safety climate studies primarily focused on either large construction companies or the construction industry as a whole, while little is known about whether company size has significant effects on workers' understanding of safety climate measures and relationships between safety climate factors and safety behavior. Thus, this study aims to: (a) test the measurement equivalence (ME) of a safety climate measure across workers from small and large companies; (b) investigate if company size alters the causal structure of the integrative model developed by Guo, Yiu, and Gonz{\'{a}}lez (2016). Method: Data were collected from 253 construction workers in New Zealand using a safety climate measure. This study used multi-group confirmatory factor analyses (MCFA) to test the measurement equivalence of the safety climate measure and structure invariance of the integrative model. Results: Results indicate that workers from small and large companies understood the safety climate measure in a similar manner. In addition, it was suggested that company size does not change the causal structure and mediational processes of the integrative model. Conclusions: Both measurement equivalence of the safety climate measure and structural invariance of the integrative model were supported by this study. Practical applications: Findings of this study provided strong support for a meaningful use of the safety climate measure across construction companies in different sizes. Safety behavior promotion strategies designed based on the integrative model may be well suited for both large and small companies. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd and National Safety Council},

abstract = {Introduction: An efficient decision-making process is one of the major necessities in the performance analysis of road safety for human safety and budget allocation procedure. Method: During the road safety analysis procedure, data envelopment analysis (DEA) supports policymakers in differentiating between risky and safe segments of a homogeneous highway. Cross risk, an extension of the DEA models, provides more information about risky segments for ranking purpose. After the identification of risky segments, the next goal is to identify those factors that are major contributors in making the segments risky. Results: This research proposes a methodology to analyze road safety performance by using a combination of DEA with the decision tree (DT) technique. The proposed methodology not only provides a facility to identify problematic road segments with the help of DEA but also identifies contributing factors with the help of DT.

abstract = {The air traffic environment is a complex system that involves several players. Between the air navigation service provider (ANPS) and the final client, many different organizations act with different purposes but are strongly interfaced. Changes and modifications in terms of technology, predefined process, or personnel are constantly needed, requiring coordination among the stakeholders. However, due to the high level of interaction between the players, any change in a complex system like the air traffic environment requires risk management. This paper demonstrates the suitability and advantages of the System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes/Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STAMP/STPA) method to be applied to the risk assessment of an operational air traffic modification. The method, which had never been used on an air traffic problem in Brazil before, was applied considering the implementation of segregated simultaneous operation at the Guarulhos International Airport. The results were proven to be effective in terms of deriving useful safety requirements. From such demonstration, STAMP/STPA can be considered as a feasible alternative to the brainstorming method currently applied for risk assessment and generation of safety requirements regarding modifications in the structure of the air traffic services (ATS) in Brazil. {\textcopyright} 2022, Journal of Aerospace Technology and Management.

This article examines how viewing work as a sociotechnical system – using visual models and representations – helps in understanding how work is performed and how it contributes to safe operations. A series of five models, developed using methods from Activity Theory, Cybernetics, Cognitive Systems Engineering and Resilience Engineering, are used to illustrate the work of maritime pilots and Vessel Traffic Services operators. Each model is examined using a modelling framework for prospective safety assessment, with the conclusion that it is how the models are applied, rather than their underlying methodologies, which determines their usefulness in this context.

Recent research suggests that to improve industrial safety we must design work systems that better support operators as they seek to control unexpected and unprecedented situations. A novel human factors technique called SAfER - Strategies Analysis for Enhancing Resilience - has been developed to help practitioners identify the range of strategies that human operators might use to manage expected, unexpected, and unprecedented situations. SAfER also helps practitioners identify design changes that should promote the selection of successful control strategies, as well as design changes that should prevent or tolerate the selection of any potential unsuccessful control strategies. Tests revealed that participants found SAfER to be a useful method capable of helping them identify novel insights and identify design changes that could help operators as they control systems across different operating situations.

abstract = {Humans are and will remain one of the critical constituents of a technological system. The study of human factors is a broad domain with equally varying applications. Furthermore, with the advent of new technologies in safety-critical systems there is always a need to ensure system safety and reliability in accordance with increasingly demanding certification standards. Human reliability is a cause of concern as hardware becomes increasingly reliable and relatively human error is rising in its share of causing an accident. Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) provides a way to quantify the risk associated with a human. This paper presents a discussion on the development of a HRA model for the domain of transportation, rail transport in particular. Railway specific human factors studies are analyzed to identify safety relevant factors in order to create a relevant and relatively applicable Performance Shaping Factor list. This list of factors is compared with railway specific studies to address domain specific concerns, further augmenting it with quantification levels for each. A discussion on our proposition towards the integration of HRA for obtaining human induced system-level risk taking into account uncertainty in data and current work's positioning in proposed methodology is also included. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors},

However, information flow in collaborative systems is complex, not always transparent to elderly users, and may raise privacy and security concerns. Because older adults' decisions about whether to engage in information exchange affects interpersonal communications and delivery of care, it is important to understand the factors and context that influence those decisions. Our work contributes empirical evidence and suggests a systematic approach. In this paper, we present the results of semi-structured interviews with 46 older adults age 65+ about their views on information collection, transmission, and sharing. We develop a detailed model of the contextual factors that combine in complex ways to affect older adults' decision-making about information sharing. We discuss how our comprehensive model compares to existing frameworks for analyzing information sharing expectations and preferences. Finally, we suggest directions for future research and describe practical implications of our model for the design and evaluation of collaborative information-sharing systems, as well as for policy and consumer protection.},

abstract = {Background—Visual inspection is an important element of aircraft engine maintenance to assure flight safety. Predominantly performed by human operators, those maintenance activities are prone to human error. While false negatives imply a risk to aviation safety, false positives can lead to increased maintenance cost. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the human performance in visual inspection of aero engine blades, specifically the operators' consistency, accuracy, and reproducibility, as well as the system reliability. Methods—Photographs of 26 blades were presented to 50 industry practitioners of three skill levels to assess their performance. Each image was shown to each operator twice in random order, leading to N = 2600 observations. The data were statistically analysed using Attribute Agreement Analysis (AAA) and Kappa analysis. Results—The results show that operators were on average 82.5% consistent with their serviceability decision, while achieving an inspection accuracy of 67.7%. The operators' reproducibility was 15.4%, as was the accuracy of all operators with the ground truth. Subsequently, the false-positive and false-negative rates were analysed separately to the overall inspection accuracy, showing that 20 operators (40%) achieved acceptable performances, thus meeting the required standard. Conclusions—In aviation maintenance the false-negative rate of <5% as per Aerospace Standard AS13100 is arguably the single most important metric since it determines the safety outcomes. The results of this study show acceptable false-negative performance in 60% of appraisers. Thus, there is the desirability to seek ways to improve the performance. Some suggestions are given in this regard. {\textcopyright} 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Cyber security decision making is inherently complicated, with nearly every decision having knock-on consequences for an organisation's vulnerability and exposure. This is further compounded by the fact that decision-making actors are rarely security experts and may have an incomplete understanding of the security that the organisation currently has in place. They must contend with a multitude of possible security options that they may only partially understand. This challenge is met by decision makers' risk thinking - their strategies for identifying risks, assessing their severity, and prioritising responses. We study the risk thinking strategies employed by teams of participants in an existing dataset derived from a tabletop cyber-physical systems security game. Our analysis identifies four structural patterns of risk thinking and two reasoning strategies: risk-first and opportunity-first. Our work highlights that risk-first approaches (as prescribed by the likes of NIST-800-53 and ISO 27001) are followed neither substantially nor exclusively when it comes to decision making. Instead, our analysis finds that decision making is affected by the plasticity of teams - that is, the ability to readily switch between ideas and practising both risk-first and opportunity-first reasoning.},

abstract = {NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Johnson Space Center (JSC) Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) uses two human reliability analysis (HRA) methodologies. The first is a simplified method which is based on how much time is available to complete the action, with consideration included for environmental and personal factors that could influence the human's reliability. This method is expected to provide a conservative value or placeholder as a preliminary estimate. This preliminary estimate or screening value is used to determine which placeholder needs a more detailed assessment. The second methodology is used to develop a more detailed human reliability assessment on the performance of critical human actions. This assessment needs to consider more than the time available, this would include factors such as: the importance of the action, the context, environmental factors, potential human stresses, previous experience, training, physical design interfaces, available procedures/checklists and internal human stresses. The more detailed assessment is expected to be more realistic than that based primarily on time available. When performing an HRA on a system or process that has an operational history, we have information specific to the task based on this history and experience. In the case of a Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) that is based on a new design and has no operational history, providing a 'reasonable' assessment of potential crew actions becomes more challenging. To determine what is expected of future operational parameters, the experience from individuals who had relevant experience and were familiar with the system and process previously implemented by NASA was used to provide the 'best' available data. Personnel from Flight Operations, Flight Directors, Launch Test Directors, Control Room Console Operators, and Astronauts were all interviewed to provide a comprehensive picture of previous NASA operations. Verification of the assumptions and expectations expressed in the assessments will be needed when the procedures, flight rules, and operational requirements are developed and then finalized. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper describes two complementary approaches to modeling and simulation (M&S) of sophisticated malware attacks for their use in understanding and preparing for potential threats. Modern malware operates at multiple scales, and successfully defending against these attacks requires the ability to understand the effects of decisions across this range. We present two types of M&S frameworks that differ in fidelity and scalability. The first is a low fidelity, scalable approach for representing and studying the spread of malware in a large network at a macro scale. The network is both modelled and simulated in ns-3, a discrete event simulation tool typically used for protocol exploration and traffic monitoring that supports the simulation of tens of thousands of nodes. The second type of simulation is a higher-fidelity, micro scale approach that includes nodes that closely emulate the behavior of actual computer systems and may include real hardware and software. Ns-3 allows outside networks to interact in real-time with ns-3. This enables the combination of the network simulation environment with real and virtual machines to allow detailed observation of the ways in which a hypothetical advanced persistent threat would play out in a small subnetwork. The interface between the ns-3 simulation, attack framework (e.g. Metasploit), and the real and virtual nodes is managed by a controller that also supplies configuration, business logic and results logging. We present use cases for both simulation types, showing how each approach can be used in the analysis of malware. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework to classify threats to power system secure operation. Threats have long been recognized; however, there lacks a categorical classification of them due to various individual perspectives from different organizations. The power system is evolving to a smart, super, and clean grid, accompanied by interior diversified and emerging threats. Furthermore, threats from exterior factors, intentional and non-intentional, conventional and new-born, to power systems have become more severe than ever before. Therefore, a distinct catalogue, description, and possible impact of these threats are proposed to meet the need of preventing power system from dangers. Using the proposed classification, a quantitative trend analysis of more than a hundred representative historic blackouts is performed to figure out the principal threats and the changing trend of threats over time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This is not the 1950's where test pilots needed the ‘right stuff' and certainly not the beginning of aviation where the Wright brother's early designs needed pilots with more than the right stuff. In those formative years of aviation and jet development, designers and pilots did not have the same design understanding and knowledge that we have today. In addition, they did not have the same understanding and knowledge of Systems Safety engineering and Human Factors expertise that we have today. Manned suborbital flights of today should be undertaken in vehicles that have been designed effectively with appropriately derived safety requirements including fault-tolerance, safe life and design-for-minimum risk approaches – and all to an acceptable level of safety. Therefore, although initial suborbital pilots will originate from flight test schools and still possess similar traits to their earlier test pilot brethren, they should be protected by the right (safe) thing by design and analysis rather than rely on the right stuff due to ineffective design and operating procedures. The paper presents a review of the SpaceShip2 accident as a case study to highlight the right (safe) things that should be considered in the design, analysis and operations for suborbital operators. The authors of this paper contend that suborbital piloted vehicles should be designed with the knowledge and understanding and lessons learned from those early X-plane flights, lessons learned from general space safety, lessons learned from pilot Human Factors/Crew Resource Management training and by understanding that safety management and safety engineering are essential disciplines that should be integrated with the design team from the concept phase. {\textcopyright} 2017 International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety},

abstract = {This project aimed to provide a greater understanding of the systemic factors involved in mining accidents, and to examine those organisational and supervisory failures that are predictive of sub-standard performance at operator level. A sample of 263 significant mining incidents in Australia across 2007-2008 were analysed using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Two human factors specialists independently undertook the analysis. Incidents occurred more frequently in operations concerning the use of surface mobile equipment (38%) and working at heights (21%), however injury was more frequently associated with electrical operations and vehicles and machinery. Several HFACS categories appeared frequently: skill-based errors (64%) and violations (57%), issues with the physical environment (56%), and organisational processes (65%). Focussing on the overall system, several factors were found to predict the presence of failures in other parts of the system, including planned inappropriate operations and team resource management; inadequate supervision and team resource management; and organisational climate and inadequate supervision. It is recommended that these associations deserve greater attention in future attempts to develop accident countermeasures, although other significant associations should not be ignored. In accordance with findings from previous HFACS-based analyses of aviation and medical incidents, efforts to reduce the frequency of unsafe acts or operations should be directed to a few critical HFACS categories at the higher levels: organisational climate, planned inadequate operations, and inadequate supervision. While remedial strategies are proposed it is important that future efforts evaluate the utility of the measures proposed in studies of system safety. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Light inland helicopter has for several years been the most accident-prone sector within commercial aviation, with a more than 10 times higher accident risk than offshore helicopters. The main aims of this article are to: 1) Examine why accidents with light inland helicopters occur, focusing especially on the situation in Norway, but also internationally and 2) discuss how these accidents can be prevented. These questions are examined based on three data sources: 1) Analysis of reports from the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN), 2) Qualitative expert interviews, and 3) Systematic literature review. Most of the reviewed studies point to combinations of human errors and technical failures as the major risk factors contributing to helicopter accidents. Our analysis contributes to existing research by also indicating the critical importance of work-related factors like inadequate safety management systems, poor safety culture and challenging framework conditions for pilot behaviour and safety. The literature review indicates a lack of robustly evaluated helicopter safety interventions to address the identified risk factors. Our analysis of the AIBN reports and the interviews indicates a need for measures aiming to improve the safety culture in a sector with challenging framework conditions. Measures focusing on the development of self-imposed and commonly accepted operational limits and guidelines in the sector are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Authors},

abstract = {A safety analysis was performed to determine possible accidental events in the storage system used in the liquefied natural gas regasification plant using the integrated application of failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) and hazard and operability analysis (HAZOP) methodologies. The goal of the FMECA technique is the estimation of component failure modes and their major effects, whereas HAZOP is a structured and systematic technique that provides an identification of the hazards and the operability problems using logical sequences of cause-deviation-consequence of process parameters. The proposed FMECA and HAZOP integrated analysis (FHIA) has been designed as a tool for the development of specific criteria for reliability and risk data organisation and to gain more recommendations than those typically provided by the application of a single methodology. This approach has been applied to the risk analysis of the LNG storage systems under construction in Porto Empedocle, Italy. The results showed that FHIA is a useful technique to better and more consistently identify the potential sources of human errors, causal factors in faults, multiple or common cause failures and correlation of cause-consequence of hazards during the various steps of the process. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The importance of protecting information in banks and mitigating security breach is becoming more important than ever. Human factors represent essential issues in information systems security in organizations, since human factors determine the behavior of employees toward information systems security. Extant literature revealed that the human factor aspect is one of the emerging research areas in information security. Thus, this research tries to explore information systems security countermeasures that are used to reduce internal threat and how employees perceive them and create a human factors model to address human factor gaps in information systems security in commercial banks in Ethiopia. Accordingly, a conceptual human factor model is developed from literature. A qualitative case study research design is employed to validate the proposed conceptual framework in selected banks in Ethiopia. Purposive sampling is employed to select the sampled banks. The samples are selected based on eligibility criteria that the respondents should have experience and expertise in information systems security and the banking activities. The research contributes to the current knowledge of information security by demonstrating the importance and critical role of human factors in the development of an information systems security model. The main contribution would be the advancement of the theoretical and practical basis for information systems security in proposing a model framework for developing, assessing and modeling a human factor model. Furthermore, it improves the understanding of risks in the security incident stages in relation to human factors. {\textcopyright} IEOM Society International.},

abstract = {Distracted driving is acknowledged universally as a large and growing road safety problem. Compounding the problem is that distracted driving is a complex, multifaceted issue influenced by a multitude of factors, organisations and individuals. As such, management of the problem is not straightforward. Numerous countermeasures have been developed and implemented across the globe. The vast majority of these measures have derived from the traditional reductionist, driver-centric approach to distraction and have failed to fully reflect the complex mix of actors and components that give rise to drivers becoming distracted. An alternative approach that is gaining momentum in road safety is the systems approach, which considers all components of the system and their interactions as an integrated whole. In this paper, we review the current knowledge base on driver distraction and argue that the systems approach is not currently being realised in practice. Adopting a more holistic, systems approach to distracted driving will not only improve existing knowledge and interventions from the traditional approach, but will enhance our understanding and management of distraction by considering the complex relationships and interactions of the multiple actors and the myriad sources, enablers and interventions that make up the distracted driving system. It is only by recognising and understanding how all of the system components work together to enable distraction to occur, that we can start to work on solutions to help mitigate the occurrence and consequences of distracted driving. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been used to train for various operations and dangerous circumstances where it is believed that training objectives cannot be achieved easily or the cost will prohibitive. Van Wyk and colleagues (2009) define VR-based training environments as “real-time computer simulations of the real world, in which visual realism, object behavior and user interaction are essential elements”. The use of VR-based training environments assumes that Human-Machine interaction stimulates learning processes through better experiencing and improved memorization, leading to a more effective transfer of the learning outcomes into workplace environments. However, there are many human factors (internally and externally), which have impact on the quality of the training and learning process which need to be identified and investigated. In this article, initially factors affecting the quality of the training and learning process for underground mine rescuers have been identified and then measured by using pre- and post-training questionnaires. Then statistical analyses have been performed to investigate the relationship among trainees' perceived realism, usefulness and success. Also, trainers' perception on 360-VR usefulness and success has been measured and compared with trainees. As the result of analysis indicated, trainees typically found the training sessions useful and perceived them to be successful; many felt that it was not really consistent with their real life experience. It would appear that perceived usefulness plays important role in forming the perception of success with high correlation and that the level of realism is not necessarily a deciding factor. Also, there was no significant difference between perceived usefulness and success between trainees and trainers. This research was conducted in collaboration with Mines Rescue Pty Ltd (a training provider for the coal mining industry in NSW, Australia) and was focused on training programs developed for mine rescue brigades. Data was collected from 94 mine rescue brigades (trainees) who attended a 360-VR training session over a twelvemonth period and 25 trainers who run the training sessions. {\textcopyright} 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

abstract = {Private and public organizations have long relied on intrusion detection systems to alert them of malicious activity in their digital networks. These systems were designed to detect threat signatures in static networks or infer anomalous activity based on their security 'logs'. They are, however, of limited use to detect threats across heterogeneous, modern-day networks, where computing resources are distributed across cloud or routing services. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) have led to the development of autonomous threat detection (ATD) applications that monitor, evaluate, and respond to malicious activity with minimal human intervention. The use of 'intelligent' and programmable algorithms for ATD will reduce incident response times and enhance the capacity of states to detect threats originating from any layer of their territorial information and communications technologies (ICT) infrastructure. This paper argues that ATD technologies will influence the evolution of a due diligence rule for cyberspace by raising the standard of care owed by states to prevent their networks from being used for malicious, transboundary ICT activities. This paper comprises five sections. Section 1 introduces the paper and its central argument. Section 2 outlines broad trends and operational factors pushing public and private entities towards the adoption of ATD. Section 3 offers an overview of a typical ATD application. Section 4 analyses the impact of ATD on the due diligence obligations of states. Section 5 presents the paper's conclusions.  {\textcopyright} 2022 NATO CCDCOE.},

abstract = {Online experiments have become a ubiquitous aspect of design and engineering processes within Internet firms. As the scale of experiments has grown, so has the complexity of their design and implementation. In response, firms have developed software frameworks for designing and deploying online experiments. Ensuring that experiments in these frameworks are correctly designed and that their results are trustworthy-referred to as internal validity-can be difficult. Currently, verifying internal validity requires manual inspection by someone with substantial expertise in experimental design. We present the first approach for statically checking the internal validity of online experiments. Our checks are based on well-known problems that arise in experimental design and causal inference. Our analyses target PlanOut, a widely deployed, open-source experimentation framework that uses a domain-specific language to specify and run complex experiments. We have built a tool called PlanAlyzer that checks PlanOut programs for a variety of threats to internal validity, including failures of randomization, treatment assignment, and causal sufficiency. PlanAlyzer uses its analyses to automatically generate contrasts, a key type of information required to perform valid statistical analyses over the results of these experiments. We demonstrate PlanAlyzer's utility on a corpus of PlanOut scripts deployed in production at Facebook, and we evaluate its ability to identify threats to validity on a mutated subset of this corpus. PlanAlyzer has both precision and recall of 92% on the mutated corpus, and 82% of the contrasts it generates match hand-specified data.},

For this purpose, data were collected and analyzed by distributing 141 questionnaires among the staff of this university. The research hypotheses have been tested by structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS and Lisrel software. The results show that the ability has the greatest impact on information security behaviors, followed by opportunity and motivation, which have a direct and significant impact on behavior. In addition, motivation mediates the impact of opportunity and ability.

abstract = {Poor hazard recognition skills and high tolerance for risk are well-known contributing factors to high fatality rates plaguing the construction industry. The prevailing safety training techniques involve one-way delivery of slideshow presentations with written handouts that often describe common hazards and generic solutions. Such delivery does not facilitate active learning, development of contextual examples, or emotional engagement necessary for adult learners to gain new knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new multimedia learning simulation-based training program called naturalistic injury simulation (NIS). Naturalistic injury simulation involves demonstrating the cause and effect of hand injuries using a hyperrealistic replica of a human hand within realistic scenarios. Out of 1,200 workers that participated, 489 workers were randomly selected for the quasi-field-based longitudinal experiment. Change in emotional states among the participants due to the simulations was analyzed across various demographical dimensions. Analysis showed that workers experienced a surge in negative emotions. Findings suggest that NIS will lead workers across the different demographical groups to perceive more risk by being more vigilant and detail oriented. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {The human factor is a source of errors that arises not only in airports activities but also in the process of internal and external communication. The hybrid campaign consists of a spectrum of classic tools, called DIMEFIL, which affect the dimensions of power in seven areas (diplomacy / politics, information, armed forces, economics, finance, intelligence, public order and the rule of law) [1]. Hybrid threats are a complex and multidimensional threat caused by the convergence and interconnection of various elements of social life [2]. The hybrid threat aim is to weaken mutual ties and conduct different types of espionage. Espionage can be part of the attack preparation, mostly in a latent form, or to get information security technological progress. Determining the level of cyber security requires investigating phenomena and activities that could pose real or potential threats to the internal and external communications of critical infrastructure [3, 4]. Security of critical infrastructure is important not only in aviation but also in other industries such as metallurgy. This is mainly due to environmental protection and the possibility of an ecological disaster [5]. Modern society is not only connected by computer networks, but we are increasingly dependent on technical infrastructure. The interconnectedness of the infrastructure systems creates a dependency where the failure of one infrastructure subject affects the functionality of other infrastructure elements [6]. Mutual multilevel infrastructure systems interconnection is a modern society development basic prerequisite. Assessing the level of infrastructure vulnerability is directed in two ways, technical and human failure. The authors analyzed aerospace technical infrastructure inter-connectivity and an internal communication vulnerability. The authors analyzed the elements of an inter-connectivity level protection of aerospace technical infrastructure and internal communication vulnerability. The authors concluded that by reducing the disconnection point's number and splitting internal ways, they are a possible solution to cut the penetration possibility into the internal network of air transport entities. The results of the research show that interdependent systems should have internal systems divided into open systems for outdoor and indoor access, with no external access. Protection against intrusion is the first phase and requires the firewalls and antivirus programs implementation in the critical infrastructure network. The monitoring systems implementation is the most suitable solution to protect against data leaks, which is the most risky area, by employees and visitors. An aircraft monitoring system gains, monitors, process, and records aircraft system condition (characteristics) and failures [7]. The authors believe that the ongoing use of penetration tests [8] based on a simulated hacker attack is a proper method of verifying the level of cyber security. {\textcopyright} 2020 Challenges to National Defence in Contemporary Geopolitical Situation.

Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.},

abstract = {Many industries are subjected to major hazards, which are of great concern to stakeholders groups. Accordingly, efforts to control these hazards and manage risks are increasingly made, supported by improved computational capabilities and the application of sophisticated safety and reliability models. Recent events, however, have revealed that apparently rare or seemingly unforeseen scenarios, involving complex interactions between human factors, technologies and organisations, are capable of triggering major catastrophes. The purpose of this work is to enhance stakeholders' trust in risk management by developing a framework to verify if tendencies and patterns observed in major accidents were appropriately contemplated by risk studies. This paper first discusses the main accident theories underpinning major catastrophes. Then, an accident dataset containing contributing factors from major events occurred in high-technology industrial domains serves as basis for the application of a clustering and data mining technique (self-organising maps – SOM), allowing the exploration of accident information gathered from in-depth investigations. Results enabled the disclosure of common patterns in major accidents, leading to the development of an attribute list to validate risk assessment studies to ensure that the influence of human factors, technological issues and organisational aspects was properly taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The new positive taxonomy as Safety Factors, which are based on high level positive functions that are prerequisite for safe transport operations, is used for reviewing the incident reports. Accident reports are shown as a reliable source of evidence to extract the most significant contributing factors in the events. Mandatory incident reports are considered useful for understanding the effective barriers as risk control measures.

abstract = {Governments are increasingly turning to algorithmic risk assessments when making important decisions, such as whether to release criminal defendants before trial. Policymakers assert that providing public servants with algorithmic advice will improve human risk predictions and thereby lead to better (e.g., fairer) decisions. Yet because many policy decisions require balancing risk-reduction with competing goals, improving the accuracy of predictions may not necessarily improve the quality of decisions. If risk assessments make people more attentive to reducing risk at the expense of other values, these algorithms would diminish the implementation of public policy even as they lead to more accurate predictions. Through an experiment with 2,140 lay participants simulating two high-stakes government contexts, we provide the first direct evidence that risk assessments can systematically alter how people factor risk into their decisions. These shifts counteracted the potential benefits of improved prediction accuracy. In the pretrial setting of our experiment, the risk assessment made participants more sensitive to increases in perceived risk; this shift increased the racial disparity in pretrial detention by 1.9%. In the government loans setting of our experiment, the risk assessment made participants more risk-averse; this shift reduced government aid by 8.3%. These results demonstrate the potential limits and harms of attempts to improve public policy by incorporating predictive algorithms into multifaceted policy decisions. If these observed behaviors occur in practice, presenting risk assessments to public servants would generate unexpected and unjust shifts in public policy without being subject to democratic deliberation or oversight.},

abstract = {An individual's risk-taking propensity is "the stable tendency to choose options with a lower probability of success, but greater rewards". This risk propensity plays a central role in decision making by customers as well as managers, and is a mediator in behavior associated with security, privacy, health, finance, and well-being. Most common approach to understanding an individual's risk propensity remain lab-based games and surveys. Administering such surveys and games is a manual, time, and money intensive process that is also fraught with multiple biases. Recently, smartphones are increasingly seen as large-scale sensors of human activity, recording data related to physical and social aspects of people's lives. Building on this trend we investigate the potential of passive phone-based data for automatically inferring an individual's risk propensity. Specifically, we describe a novel approach to model an individual's risk propensity based on her mobile phone usage. Based on a 10-week field + lab study involving 50 participants, we report that: (1) multiple phone-based features (e.g., average gyradius) are intricately associated with participants' risk propensity; and (2) a phone-based model outperforms demography-based models by 39% in terms of accuracy of predicting risk propensity. In organizational terms, a better understanding of risk behavior could contribute significantly to risk management programs. At the same time, such results could open doors for more nuanced understanding of the underlying human risk phenomena and their interconnections with social and mobility behavior.},

The biometric consists of 20 features that allow us to reliably distinguish users based on differences in these patterns. We leverage this distinguishing power along with the ability to gauge the users' task familiarity, that is, level of knowledge, to address insider threats. In a controlled experiment, we test how both time and task familiarity influence eye movements and feature stability, and how different subsets of features affect the classifier performance. These feature subsets can be used to tailor the eye movement biometric to different authentication methods and threat models. Our results show that eye movement biometrics support reliable and stable continuous authentication of users. We investigate different approaches in which an attacker could attempt to use inside knowledge to mimic the legitimate user. Our results show that while this advance knowledge is measurable, it does not increase the likelihood of successful impersonation. In order to determine the time stability of our features, we repeat the experiment twice within 2 weeks. The results indicate that we can reliably authenticate users over the entire period. We show that lower sampling rates provided by low-cost hardware pose a challenge, but that reliable authentication is possible even at the rate of 50Hz commonly available with consumer-level devices. In a second set of experiments, we evaluate how our authentication system performs across a variety of real-world tasks, including reading, writing, and web browsing. We discuss the advantages and limitations of our approach in detail and give practical insights on the use of this biometric in a real-world environment.},

In this context, understanding the risks related to the use and potential misuse of information about homes, partners, and end-users, as well as, forming methods for integrating security-enhancing measures in the design is not straightforward and thus requires substantial investigation. A risk analysis applied on a smart home automation system developed in a research project involving leading industrial actors has been conducted. Out of 32 examined risks, 9 were classified as low and 4 as high, i.e., most of the identified risks were deemed as moderate. The risks classified as high were either related to the human factor or to the software components of the system. The results indicate that with the implementation of standard security features, new, as well as, current risks can be minimized to acceptable levels albeit that the most serious risks, i.e., those derived from the human factor, need more careful consideration, as they are inherently complex to handle. A discussion of the implications of the risk analysis results points to the need for a more general model of security and privacy included in the design phase of smart homes. With such a model of security and privacy in design in place, it will contribute to enforcing system security and enhancing user privacy in smart homes, and thus helping to further realize the potential in such IoT environments. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Through the application of HOST, human and system performance hazards and their impacts are identified. Utilizing systems engineering processes and human-system interaction models, the ramifications of those hazards are traced beyond the immediate hazard actor impact to identify other system and actor impacts. HOST provides a structured methodology for assessing and prioritizing human and system performance hazards based on severity, likelihood, and detection/recovery. The consistent structure underlying the human-system interaction models further enables the identification of key safety interaction points and integration hazards associated with multiple related concepts.

Therefore, the identification and analysis of the human errors in the power dispatching is the significant to guide against the human risk and ensure the stable and safe operation of power nets. Human error identification methods have been used to identify the nature of the human errors and causal factors, and recovery strategies in many industrial domains such as the aviation, nuclear power and chemical processing industries. The Technique for Retrospective and Predictive Analysis of Cognitive Errors (TRACEr) is a human error identification technique that was developed for use in the air traffic control domain. In this study, the TRACEr was improved in the combination of the task features of the power dispatching and human information processing, and was used to identify the human errors in the power dispatching. A total of seventy-two incidents or accidents performed by operators were analyzed. The analyzing processing was carried out with the objective of classifying task error, identifying external error modes, internal error modes and psychological error mechanisms, and identifying the performance shaping factors. The performance factors analysis considered the time, interface, training and experience, procedures, organization, stress and complexity which may have an impact to the task and help to propose some recovery strategies. The results revealed that the identification was a necessary and effective step toward the safety improvement of power dispatching. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

We found that (1) vulnerabilities related to improper resource control (e.g., session fixation) are discovered faster and more often, as well as exploited faster, than vulnerabilities related to improper access control (e.g., weak password requirements), (2) there is a clear process followed by penetration testers of discovery/collection to lateral movement/pre-Attack. Our methodology facilitates quicker analysis of vulnerabilities in future CPTC events.},

abstract = {Modern work design must re-examine human-robot interaction and consider ways to effectively utilize emerging industrial capabilities such as collaborative robots and humanoids in the context of usability and our emerging service economy. By incorporating human aspects into technology-based efforts focused on value co-creation, it appears likely that inexpensive collaborative robots and humanoids can serve as integral parts of effective smart service systems designs. Ways to create value through such human-robot interaction are highlighted through recent research. A change in paradigm will need to occur to shift emphasis from ‘block the path' to ‘design out' when it comes to effective human-robot interaction in the workplace. It is apparent that smart service development will continue through multi-disciplinary initiatives that are human-centered. Usability and other human factors principles will continue to be central to successes. Organizational aspects that recognize fundamental relationships between job satisfaction and service quality can provide a foundation upon which capabilities of humanoids and collaborative robots can be leveraged in modern industrial and smart operations. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract = {This article proposes methodologies and applications for sustainability solutions through usability. Usability and sustainability are defined in the context of human factors and ergonomics. Economic, social and ecological considerations form the basis for the three leg platform for sustainable development. A return to fundamentals in human factors, ergonomics and industrial and operations engineering can provide insight into effective implementation of sustainability solutions. Principles such as learning curves and economies of scale are highlighted in the context of sustainable energy. It is also suggested that exposure-response curves can be derived using Bayesian networks, giving insight into potential causal effects in existing ecotoxicology data. Ergonomists have used these tools in the past to evaluate performance of other engineering implementations while toxicology can initially provide some common basis for the historical and modern view of ergonomics in the context of sustainability. Sustainability can benefit from such tools that can evaluate potential interventions under uncertainty. From other engineering literature it appears that technical solutions are already available to support sustainability, while the lag may be occurring in coordinating the social, organizational and cultural response. Lessons learned in human factors and ergonomics can support sustainability related interventions building on experience in human-system interface design and visualizations that have been an integral part of the digital human modeling community especially over the last two decades. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract = {Customizability is a key feature of the Android operating system that differentiates it from Apple's iOS. One concrete feature that gaining popularity is called "app virtualization''. This feature allows multiple copies of the same app to be installed and opened simultaneously (e.g., with multiple accounts logged in). Virtualization frameworks are used by more than 100 million users worldwide. As with any new system features, we are interested in two aspects: (1) whether the feature itself introduces security risks and (2) whether the feature is abused for unintended purposes. This paper conducts a systematic study on the two aspects of the app virtualization techniques.With a thorough study of 32 popular virtualization frameworks from Google Play, we identify seven areas of potential attack vectors and find that most of the frameworks are susceptible to them. By deeply investigating their ecosystem, we show, with demonstrations, that attackers can easily distribute malware that takes advantage of these attack vectors. In addition, we show that the same virtualization techniques are also abused by malware as an alternative and easy-to-use repackaging mechanism. To this end, we design and implement a new app repackage detector. After scanning 250,145 apps from app markets, it finds 164 repackaged apps that attempt to steal user credentials and private data.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to optionally-piloted aircraft is useful for in-flight tests of new automatic controller's concepts. The safety of this kind of experiment is an issue addressed in this paper. The prediction of possible safety-influencing factors makes it possible to assess the pilot's ability to effectively prevent safety risks. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis in this research paper focusses on two cases of monitoring; similar control standards for both pilot in command and the monitoring pilot or technical systems in one of these tasks and dissimilar control standard when monitoring pilot is not familiar with a control manner of the pilot in command or of the automatic control system. The increased workload is expected in the last case as the result of additional activities determined theoretically in the presented analysis. Details of the possible threats are obtained by simulation tests with various factors influencing the safety of landing. In addition to determining threats, the analysis includes the possibility of in time threat detection and preserving action. Findings: The results show that the safety pilot has a different task than the pilot in command and needs to be familiar with the general principles of automatic controller operations and the particular algorithm being tested. Although commonly used landing procedure is relatively error-tolerant, new landing procedures for use in some specific conditions need more precise control and additional safety pilot preparation. Additional information presented to both the pilot in command and the safety pilot may increase mode and state awareness and reduce reaction time in an emergency condition. Practical implications: In-flight tests of non-standard control algorithms there is a need to include additional preparation of the equipment and safety pilot. The research in this paper illustrates how to determine threats and safety-critical moments during the experimental flight can be observed. The danger is mitigated by the safety pilot, if familiar with both proper and improper operations of the controller and how the pilot in command should detect and predict danger caused by the tested control system. Originality/value: The presented method of analysis combines the human factor with various technical aspects. The results obtained illustrate the real tasks of the person supervising the operation of the automatic control system and the role of a human as a safety pilot. {\textcopyright} 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Holistic assessment of cyber security risks is a complex multi-component and multi-level problem involving hardware, software, environmental, and human factors. As part of an on-going effort to develop a holistic, predictive cyber security risk assessment model, the characterization of human factors, which includes human behavior, is needed to understand how the actions of users, defenders, and attackers affect cyber security risk. The work group developing this new cyber security risk assessment model and framework has chosen to distinguish between trust and confidence by using “trust” only for human factors, and “confidence” for all non-human factors (e.g. hardware and software) in order to reduce confusion between the two concepts within our model. We have developed an initial framework for how to incorporate trust as a factor/parameter within a larger characterization of the human influences (users, defenders and attackers) on cyber security risk. Trust in the human factors is composed of two main categories: inherent characteristics, that which is a part of the individual, and situational characteristics, that which is outside of the individual. The use of trust as a human factor in holistic cyber security risk assessment will also rely on understanding how differing mental models and risk postures impact the level trust given to an individual and the biases affecting the ability to give said trust. {\textcopyright} 2015},

abstract = {There are interrelationships between crash causes, countermeasures, and policy implications, but they are not necessarily direct and obvious. Part of the problem is the definition of a cause. The seminal 1979 Indiana University “Study of Accident Causes” has cemented some false assumptions that must be overcome to yield an effective crash countermeasures policy. The taxonomy of crash causes and the prevalence of different causes are determined by the investigators, who are biased in different ways. The prevalent notion that approximately 90 percent of the crashes are due to human errors or failures is due to a threshold bias, and the implied notion that 90 percent of the countermeasures should be directed at changing these behaviors is based on an erroneous assumption that the cure must be directly linked to the stated cause. A more balanced approach to the definition of a cause and to the search for crash countermeasures is needed, and the safe system approach appears to be a most promising one. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We start by presenting new findings based on a series of semi-structured interviews with Android developers, probing into the difficulties with privacy that developers face when building apps. Based on these findings, we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of Coconut and evaluated it in a controlled lab study with 18 Android developers (including eight professional developers). Our study results suggest that apps developed with Coconut handled privacy concerns better, and the developers that used Coconut had a better understanding of their code's behavior and wrote a better privacy policy for their app. We also found that requiring developers to do a small amount of annotating work regarding their apps' personal data practices during the development process may result in a significant improvement in app privacy.},

abstract = {Operators handling abnormal situations in safety-critical environments need to be supported from a cognitive perspective to reduce their workload, stress, and consequent error rate. Of the various cognitive activities, a correct understanding of the situation, i.e. situation awareness (SA), is a crucial factor in improving performance and reducing error. However, existing system safety researches focus mainly on technical issues and often neglect SA. This study presents an innovative cognition-driven decision support system called the situation awareness support system (SASS) to manage abnormal situations in safety-critical environments in which the effect of situational complexity on human decision-makers is a concern. To achieve this objective, a situational network modeling process and a situation assessment model that exploits the specific capabilities of dynamic Bayesian networks and risk indicators are first proposed. The SASS is then developed and consists of four major elements: 1) a situation data collection component that provides the current state of the observable variables based on online conditions and monitoring systems, 2) a situation assessment component based on dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) to model the hazardous situations in a situational network and a fuzzy risk estimation method to generate the assessment result, 3) a situation recovery component that provides a basis for decision-making to reduce the risk level of situations to an acceptable level, and 4) a human-computer interface. The SASS is partially evaluated by a sensitivity analysis, which is carried out to validate DBN-based situational networks, and SA measurements are suggested for a full evaluation of the proposed system. The performance of the SASS is demonstrated by a case taken from US Chemical Safety Board reports, and the results demonstrate that the SASS provides a useful graphical, mathematically consistent system for dealing with incomplete and uncertain information to help operators maintain the risk of dynamic situations at an acceptable level. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, we investigate past experiences with authentication mechanisms emphasizing problems and aspects that hamper good user experience. Second, we investigate the different authentication factors more closely. Our results reveal particularly interesting preferences regarding the authentication factor ”ownership” in terms of properties, physical realizations, and interaction.

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are rapidly transforming the automotive industry due to rising consumer interest in these vehicles worldwide. However, few studies have compared different countries in terms of public acceptance of AVs. This study compares public acceptance of AVs as a function of risk perceptions in two countries leading the AV industry—Japan and Israel. We set our study within the risk-as-feelings framework. In contrast to “risk as analysis,” which invokes factual reasoning to bear on risk assessment and decision making, “risk as feelings” takes affective cues such as the sense of dread and unfamiliarity into judgments of risk. To this end, we conducted two web-based surveys in Japan in 2017 and Israel in 2021. In a between-subjects design, we manipulated introductory video information to portray various combinations of risk factors commonly associated with AVs: system errors, external interferences with car controls (e.g., hacking), and the inability of the AV to cope with unexpected events. Next, participants were surveyed about how they perceive the risks of AVs and other well-known technologies and activities. Results showed that acceptable risk, perceived risk, and perceived benefit of AVs were all generally higher in Israel than in Japan. The opposite pattern was found for a “risk adjustment factor,” suggesting that the Japanese seek more safety before acceptance than Israelis. Furthermore, we conducted a factor analysis on seven risk dimensions, resulting in a two-factor model of dread and unfamiliarity. Cognitive mapping of AVs and other technologies and activities in the two-factor plane revealed that the AV technologies we studied (i.e., AV-car levels 3 and 4; AV-bus levels 3 and 4) have high unfamiliarity risk but moderate dread risk compared to technologies and activities such as smoking, flying, and handguns. After exposure to video-based educational content, unfamiliarity risk was less influential but dread risk—in particular, related to human-made risks—became more influential. The results indicated that manufacturers and policymakers should emphasize mitigating human-made risks instead of focusing on improving public familiarity with AVs to garner trust and improve public acceptance of the technology. {\textcopyright} 2022 by the authors.},

abstract = {Owing to the continued use of C (and C++), spatial safety violations (e.g., buffer overflows) still constitute one of today's most dangerous and prevalent security vulnerabilities. To combat these violations, Checked C extends C with bounds-enforced checked pointer types. Checked C is essentially a gradually typed spatially safe C - checked pointers are backwards-binary compatible with legacy pointers, and the language allows them to be added piecemeal, rather than necessarily all at once, so that safety retrofitting can be incremental. This paper presents a semi-automated process for porting a legacy C program to Checked C. The process centers on 3C, a static analysis-based annotation tool. 3C employs two novel static analysis algorithms - typ3c and boun3c - to annotate legacy pointers as checked pointers, and to infer array bounds annotations for pointers that need them. 3C performs a root cause analysis to direct a human developer to code that should be refactored; once done, 3C can be re-run to infer further annotations (and updated root causes). Experiments on 11 programs totaling 319KLoC show 3C to be effective at inferring checked pointer types, and experience with previously and newly ported code finds 3C works well when combined with human-driven refactoring.},

abstract = {Integrity Management Program (IMP) is a systematic and documented program for assuring asset integrity throughout the full life cycle of an asset. To ensure safe and reliable operation, the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission (Commission) has been requiring its licensed pipeline operators through its regulations to develop and implement pipeline integrity management programs (IMPs) in accordance with Canadian Industry Standard CSA Z662. The auditing process, the collated results and findings from the IMP audit years (2011-15) were published in IPC 2016-64161[1]. Since 2016, the Commission has enhanced its IMP compliance assurance process, and aligned it with the management system approach using Deming's model of plan-do-check-act (PDCA) for IMP components and incorporated a lifecycle approach that spans the entire lifecycle of a pipeline system from planning to abandonment. In addition, the Commission has adopted a multi-criteria decision-making approach when prioritizing which operators to audit. This method utilizes weighted rank approach and takes into account multiple factors, such as, previous IMP audit results, pipeline length and product, class location, incident frequency, and asset age. Through collaborative efforts with the University of British Columbia (Okanagan), an innovative risk based audit tool - Integrity Management Program Audit and Knowledge Tool (IMPAKT) has been developed to help evaluate the compliance of operators' IMP in terms of the management system approach and its associated risk. This tool conducts three-dimensional analysis of IMP performance using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) technique and allows the Commission to generate a risk profile for each IMP component to determine which components are most critical, requiring immediate attention. The final audit results are presented as a Risk Priority Number (RPN), which is a product of severity, occurrence and action. An effective integrity management program requires a strong safety culture, therefore, safety culture aspects are incorporated into the risk based auditing tool, IMPAKT. This risk based evaluation process also allows the Commission to develop a compliance benchmark to make comparison between different operators' IMP results for continuous performance improvement. This paper presents the innovative approach developed and implemented by the Commission for the IMP compliance oversight (auditing) process and implication of such changes.

Many key distinctions important to nuclear energy HRA such as Level 1 vs. Level 2 analysis may prove insignificant for oil and gas applications. On the other hand, existing HRA methods may not be sensitive enough to factors like the extensive use of digital controls in oil and gas. This paper provides an overview of these considerations to assist in the adaptation of existing nuclear-centered HRA methods to the petroleum sector. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {In today's world, critical infrastructure is often controlled by computing systems. This introduces new risks for cyber attacks, which can compromise the security and disrupt the functionality of these systems. It is therefore necessary to build such systems with strong guarantees of resiliency against cyber attacks. One way to achieve this level of assurance is using formal verification, which provides proofs of system compliance with desired cyber security properties. The use of Formal Methods (FM) in aspects of cyber security and safety-critical systems are reviewed in this article. We split FM into the three main classes: theorem proving, model checking, and lightweight FM. To allow the different uses of FM to be compared, we define a common set of terms. We further develop categories based on the type of computing system FM are applied in. Solutions in each class and category are presented, discussed, compared, and summarised. We describe historical highlights and developments and present a state-of-the-art review in the area of FM in cyber security. This review is presented from the point of view of FM practitioners and researchers, commenting on the trends in each of the classes and categories. This is achieved by considering all types of FM, several types of security and safety-critical systems, and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly. The article hence provides a comprehensive overview of FM and techniques available to system designers of security-critical systems, simplifying the process of choosing the right tool for the task. The article concludes by summarising the discussion of the review, focusing on best practices, challenges, general future trends, and directions of research within this field.},

abstract = {Humans, their performance, actions and decisions play a significant role in a vast range of operations in complex sociotechnical systems. Numerous studies have therefore endeavoured to understand people's actions and/or inactions within their working environment and to identify those factors, also known as Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs), that contribute either positively or negatively to sociotechnical system performance. However, the majority of those studies are often created based on data and research derived from a specific domain, and therefore are difficult to apply beyond the domain of interest. Thus, this paper presents a generic framework to develop a standardised list of PSFs, referred to as (Cross-Sectoral Performance Shaping Factors, C-PSFs), to be used across sectors to describe the immediate and latent factors that affect human performance in a structured and consistent manner. Building upon the existing Railway-Performance Shaping Factors taxonomy and the fundamental concepts of Cognitive and Behavioral Science, the new C-PSFs taxonomy illustrates the numerous possible interdependencies between the human operator and a system's constraints. The former provides the empirical evidence for the C-PSFs taxonomy's generic factors, while the latter justifies the transferability and applicability of the taxonomy to a broad range of sociotechnical sectors. The analysis of two accidents, from the railway and energy sectors, support such evidence. The proposed taxonomy provides a common baseline set of PSFs across sectors and its usage can greatly improve safety management systems of cross-sectoral organisations. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {In the nuclear industry, until recently, the licensing and design of the new Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) were based upon a deterministic approach. The Probabilistic Safety Assessments (PSA) only supported the safety demonstration, mostly by the evaluation of the risks for the population and the environment. The feedbacks in the design of the NPP, when existing, were limited. Nowadays the use of the PSA becomes more systematic and is extended to the design phase of the new generation of NPP. In this frame the first approach was to develop the concepts of risk based and risk informed decision making to avoid unnecessary burden taking place in the NPP design due to the strong deterministic prescription on low probability events. Following the development of a new generation of plants, such as the AP1000 or the EPR, which considers the severe accidents in their design, the PSA Level 2 tends to contribute more and more to build the new NPPs. The accident of Fukushima Daishi NPPs even leads to an extended consideration of the severe accident in the design of the nuclear plants and the emergency organization structures. The interaction between the PSA Level 2 development and the design phase of the NPP became obvious, and part of the safety standards as recommended by the safety authorities and organizations. This paper assesses how the PSA Level 2 becomes a high visibility topic of the design phase of the NPP. The current safety requirement expectations regarding the use of the PSA Level 2 in the design phase results from this evolution. Indeed several technical areas can use the insight of a PSA Level 2 to improve the NPP design. It includes the design of hardware and systems (e.g., pipes, valves and tank but also instrumentation and control and civil engineering). It also includes the analysis of human factors, which subject covers the procedures and guidelines, the Human Machine Interface (HMI), the emergency organization, the training and the layout (access to buildings, survivability of the control room⋯). Two examples of the use of PSA Level 2 for EPR design improvement are provided and reviewed: first the modification of the severe accident spraying system, and second the HMI evaluation for the severe accident. The use of PSA Level 2 in the design phase depends of the model and the level of detail of the developed probabilistic analysis. Discussions on the areas of improvement regarding the use of the PSA Level 2 in the development of a new NPP are proposed.},

abstract = {The envisioned transformation of the National Airspace System to integrate an In-time Aviation Safety Management System (IASMS) to assure safety in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) brings unprecedented challenges to the design of human interfaces and management of safety information. Safety in design and operational safety assurance are critical factors for how humans will interact with increasingly autonomous systems. The IASMS Concept of Operations builds from traditional commercial operator safety management and scales in complexity to AAM. The transformative changes in future aviation systems pose potential new critical safety risks with novel types of aircraft and other vehicles having different performance capabilities, flying in increasingly complex airspace, and using adaptive contingencies to manage normal and non-normal operations. These changes compel development of new and emerging capabilities that enable innovative ways for humans to interact with data and manage information. Increasing complexity of AAM corresponds with use of predictive modeling, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to effectively address known hazards and emergent risks. The roles of humans will dynamically evolve in increments with this technological and operational evolution. The interfaces for how humans will interact with increasingly complex and assured systems designed to operate autonomously and how information will need to be presented are important challenges to be resolved. {\textcopyright} 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.},

Approaches in Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering do not account appropriately for the weave of dispersed practices that it takes to ‘do' IT security—practices that involve a heterogeneous set of actors and unfold at diverse sites and across organizational, legal, and professional boundaries. In this paper we propose to conceive of IT security through the lens of care, a notion that we draw from Science and Technology Studies. Caring for IT security requires continuous, often invisible work that relies upon tinkering and experimentation and addresses perennial oscillations between in-/securities. Caring for IT security, then, engages with established accountabilities and cultivates a moral stance that refrains from blaming insecurities upon single actors. We conclude with outlining a caring approach to IT security for CSCW.},

abstract = {This paper describes a human factor considered risk assessment of automated vehicle using vehicle to vehicle wireless communication (V2V communication). A human-reaction time is incorporated into the probabilistic threat assessment algorithm for the human-centered risk assessment. The V2V communication have been fused with a radar sensor to achieve more enhanced tracking performance of automated vehicle. Information fusion of two tracks, V2V communication and radar sensor, is performed using Global Nearest Neighborhood (GNN) approach. A prediction of vehicle's motion follows the basic idea of the particle filtering. Based on the predicted behavior of vehicles, a collision risk is computed numerically and 321 driver data based human reaction time are incorporated to determine an active safety control intervention moment. The humancentered risk assessment algorithm has been applied to a collision avoidance scenario to monitor threat vehicles ahead and to find the best intervention point. Effects of the vehicular communication on a target vehicle state estimation and a vehicle safety control performance are investigated. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been investigated via computer simulation studies. It has been shown from both simulations and vehicle tests that the proposed human-centered risk assessment algorithm with the V2V communication can be beneficial to active safety systems in decision of controller intervention moment and in control of automated drive for the guaranteed safety. {\textcopyright} 2018 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.},

In particular, we will go deep into a "state-of-the-art' of HRA methods. We will proceed to the identification of some specific analysis criteria expressly designed to compare and map methods against the criteria itself and previous works on the good practices within HRA Such criteria deal with key issues such as the data/information/evidence required for methods to be applied, the theoretical basis underlying each method, PSF coverage (individual, operating crews or organizational) and so on. Then, we will discuss the major findings retained to provide an understanding on useful features and limitations or gaps in current HRA. Examples of these limitations are lack of an adequate interlace for using qualitative analysis results for quantification of HEPs or an appropriate guidance for how to assess and use PSFs. In particular, we will focus on the problem of selecting performance influencing factors (PSFs) for the use in HRA of nominal operation and maintenance tasks in a different manner than existing methods already developed at EDF which are used for specific PSA applications (MERMOS A). Finally, we will present the conclusions and some perspectives concerning the development of a new methodology resulting from a cross-fertilization approach between a tool recently developed at EDF R&D and referred as Integrated Risk Analysis (IRA) and conventional URA The aim of this new methodology is to probabilistically assess human barriers efficiency in sociotechnical systems under given organizational and environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the American Nuclear Society.},

abstract = {Dynamic Risk Analysis (DRA) is a continuous, adaptive process of risk evaluation that can play a fundamental role in the prevention, control and mitigation of new or changing risks in real time. In order to better understand DRA, a systematic review was conducted, followed by thematic analysis and the development of a network model. This model depicts weighted and directional connections to reveal the significance of information and decision making in managing dynamic risk. The research also reveals that people follow rules to a point but will then adapt to meet the challenge of unexpected circumstances. The influence of the environment is also evident, as it cannot only create unique risks but exacerbate existing ones. Throughout the literature there is some debate regarding the use of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods in managing dynamic risks. However, when allied with DRA, greater resilience may be added to safety management systems. Considering the factors identified in this research offers a new approach to the problem of managing new or changing risks. What this now means in practical terms is that there is potential to develop a syllabus for DRA training. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The study of adaptation would benefit from the use of structured and formalised approaches at, and across, all levels of the organisational hierarchy (individual, team and organisation). However, with a large number of potential Human Factors methods available to the safety practitioner, it is unclear which methods are most appropriate for an exploration of this important tenet of systems thinking. A 3-round ranking Delphi study has been conducted to survey the range of methods to determine a soft consensus amongst subject matter experts. In each of the three rounds the list was successively refined.

At the meso level, CDM and CWA together with complementary methods, such as Systems Theoretic Accident Modelling and Processes (STAMP), Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) and the Event Analysis for Systemic Teamwork (EAST) method. STAMP and FRAM were recommended at the macro level, which could be complemented with Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA), Ethnographic Analysis, EAST and the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS).

abstract = {Seveso plants are complex sociotechnical systems, which makes it appropriate to support any risk assessment with a model of the system. However, more often than not, this step is only partially addressed, simplified, or avoided in safety reports. At the same time, investigations have shown that the complexity of industrial systems is frequently a factor in accidents, due to interactions between their technical, human, and organizational dimensions. In order to handle both this complexity and changes in the system over time, this article proposes an original and simplified qualitative risk evaluation method based on the system dynamics theory developed by Forrester in the early 1960s. The methodology supports the development of a dynamic risk assessment framework dedicated to industrial activities. It consists of 10 complementary steps grouped into two main activities: system dynamics modeling of the sociotechnical system and risk analysis. This system dynamics risk analysis is applied to a case study of a chemical plant and provides a way to assess the technological and organizational components of safety. {\textcopyright} 2016 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract = {This research develops a systematic method to explicitly model Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) opera ting crew as a social interactive unit and investigate their dynamic behavior inside and outside the control room under critical situations. The ultimate goal is to study the effects of team factors and t earn dynamics on the risk of such a complex and safety critical system with the main focus being o n team errors, associated causes and error management inside the team and the impact of such fact ors on team performance. This research models and evaluates team activities such as information c ollection and sharing, structure of shared mental models, team decision making and combined acti on execution. An object based modeling methodology is applied to represent system elements and different roles and behaviors within the operating team. ID AC (Information, Decision, and Action in Crew context) cognitive model is used as the basic infrastructure for the individual operator mo del, and scenario generation follows typical DPRA (Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment) meth odologies. This research has developed a customized library in MATLAB Simulink environment which facilitates the modeling process for similar applications of the methodology. The approach i s applied to simulate the operating crew behavior in response to malfunctions of a simple represent ation of NPPs in order to demonstrate the proposed modeling and simulation capabilities. The perf ormances of the operating crew with different configuration of team characteristics and influencin g team factors have been compared to each other by observing parameters of interest while operati ng on the same plant; these parameters include the quality of leadership, the quality of verbal and device-based communications from both individual and team perspectives, various team and organ izational factors and the individual characteristics of each of operators. A four-train feed water sys tem has been modeled and used as a representation of the plant. The mechanism of effect of each major category of contributing factors has been modeled by developing causal maps which calcula tes the probability of failure of basic human functions dynamically and by using a number of lowe r level influencing factors driven from the existing literature; The number of occurrence of the und esired state i.e. steam generators becoming dried-out, in the generated accident scenarios during a round of simulation as well as the timeline for operators' actions and errors are used as bases for c omparing teams. As part of the analysis, the contributing factors have been modified over their qu alitative spectrum, from one extreme level to another in order to see if the model generates intuitiv ely anticipated results. The investigation shows that a poorly qualified leader is the most influentia 1 factor on the time and quality of team actions and would cause the weakest performance; its effec t being even more significant than the effect of poor team and organizational factors and less than adequate communication inside the team.},

Qualitative data from respondents of both these groups show that the concerns are mostly similar. However, the factors perceived to alleviate privacy concerns are more varied and nuanced amongst those who have obtained a DTC genetic test. Our data suggest that privacy concerns or lack of concerns are based on complex and multiple considerations including data ownership, access control of data and regulatory authorities of social, political and legal systems. Respondents do not engage in a full cost/benefit analysis of having their DNA tested.},

abstract = {Computing science students amass years of programming experience and a wealth of factual knowledge in their undergraduate courses. Based on our combined years of experience, however, one of our students' abiding shortcomings is that they think there is only one correct answer to issues in most courses: an idealistic stance. Human-centered security, as well as other areas, requires students to understand that they have to weigh up a number of different possible solutions, and satisfice, rather than choose the one that is undeniably the best. In other words, they need to adopt a more realistic stance. Lecture-based teaching cannot develop this facility, due to its inability to engage students deeply with the issues and possible solutions. We argue that depth (in terms of understanding the complexity and issues involved) as well as breadth (in terms of appreciating the different positions taken by users on these issues) are essential for developing the realistic stance. This article reports on an instructional design that was used to help students become more realistic in their decision making. The design is based on seven educational strategies that, in tandem, help students to see the depth and breadth of topics in the course. We detail the instructional design and its application to three topic areas in the course, and report on the outcomes. We found evidence that students did indeed develop the depth and breadth we were hoping for. In concluding, we reflect on the design and the positive result, and propose changes to further improve the course. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {Exploring the significant variables related to specific types of crashes is vitally important in the planning stage of a transportation network. This paper aims to identify and examine important variables associated with total crashes and severe crashes per traffic analysis zone (TAZ) in four counties of the state of Florida by applying nonparametric statistical techniques such as data mining and random forest. The intention of investigating these factors in such aggregate level analysis is to incorporate proactive safety measures in transportation planning. Total and severe crashes per TAZ were modeled to provide predictive decision trees. The variables which carried higher weight of importance for total crashes per TAZ were - total number of intersections per TAZ, airport trip productions, light truck productions, and total roadway segment length with 35 mph posted speed limit. The other significant variables identified for total crashes were total roadway length with 15 mph posted speed limit, total roadway length with 65 mph posted speed limit, and non-home based work productions. For severe crashes, total number of intersections per TAZ, light truck productions, total roadway length with 35 mph posted speed limit, and total roadway length with 65 mph posted speed limit were among the significant variables. These variables were further verified and supported by the random forest results. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A vital safety assurance issue, also stressed by recent standards and guidelines, is the safety of human-machine interaction (HMI). This paper proposes, and shows a small example of using, a framework for human interaction safety analysis. It is intended for integration in an iterative development lifecycle and to be used in conjunction with relevant standards. In the framework, an analysis is first conducted to elicit all agreements between humans and the automated function, then an interaction analysis method is used to find potential problems with proposed interfaces affecting each agreement. Risk assessment is conducted to determine if risk reduction is necessary, and verification and validation activities are used to provide support for the analysis results and evidence of HMI safety for an assurance case.  {\textcopyright} 2021 IEEE.},

abstract = {Late Dr. Sam Mannan promoted in his last year the concept of the Safety Triad as a basis for effective process safety. As he mentioned himself, nobody will be surprised that this triad consists of Prevention, Mitigation, and Response. If everything were perfect an accident would not occur, but in hindsight after an accident experience teaches that at least one of these pillars of the triad is missing or defective. Also, given the recent hurricane Harvey experience in the Houston region, socio-technical associated hazard threats emerge not only from inside a plant but can be external: NaTech or technological accidental occurrences evoked by natural forceful events. Hence to be acceptably safe, the robustness and reliability of the triad components must be well designed, and their performance over time must be periodically verified. This objective supposes a risk-based approach both for design and for reliable operation. However, risk assessment itself is fallible. Over the years it has been shown that there are many limitations, but fortunately during the last few years we have seen an advent of new approaches, methods, and techniques to perform a more realistic scenario definition of what can go wrong, enabling to cope with uncertainties in models and parameter values, to analyze the risk dynamics of situations, such as reliability and availability degradation, but also process risk evolving in continuous processes. In all this, not only the technical aspects but also the associated human and organizational factors must be included. The latter dominate the scene in many situations. Last but not least is the concept of resilience in case risks are overlooked due to lack of knowledge or even to the notorious “black swan” incidents. Preparing for unexpected events should provide not only error tolerant design but early warning agility, capability to improvise, and means to recover operations. It is business continuity that will be at stake! The paper will elaborate both the triad and Sam Mannan's view on risk assessment. {\textcopyright} 2019},

abstract = {Real-time risk assessment of autonomous driving at tactical and operational levels is extremely challenging since both contextual and circumferential factors should concurrently be considered. Recent methods have started to simultaneously treat the context of the traffic environment along with vehicle dynamics. In particular, interaction-aware motion models that take inter-vehicle dependencies into account by utilizing the Bayesian interference are employed to mutually control multiple factors. However, communications between vehicles are often assumed and the developed models are required many parameters to be tuned. Consequently, they are computationally very demanding. Even in the cases where these desiderata are fulfilled, current approaches cannot cope with a large volume of sequential data from organically changing traffic scenarios, especially in highly complex operational environments such as dense urban areas with heterogeneous road users. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a new risk assessment methodology that integrates a network-level collision estimate with a vehicle-based risk estimate in real-time under the joint framework of interaction-aware motion models and Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN). Following the formulation and explanation of the required functions, machine learning classifiers were utilized for the real-time network-level collision prediction and the results were then incorporated into the integrated DBN model for predicting collision probabilities in real-time. Results indicated an enhancement of the interaction-aware model by up to 10%, when traffic conditions are deemed as collision-prone. Hence, it was concluded that a well-calibrated collision prediction classifier provides a crucial hint for better risk perception by autonomous vehicles. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Emerging threats create the need for a well-established capacity for responding to unwanted incidents. Such a capacity is influenced by organizational, human, and technological factors. We have conducted extensive fieldwork for 2.5 years in Norwegian electric power companies with the aim of identifying challenges for improving information security incident management practices. Semi-structured interviews, document analysis, a survey and participant observations have been performed as part of this case study. We describe how training for responding to information security incidents is given low priority and that different types of personnel, such as business managers and technical personnel, have different perspectives and priorities in regard to information security. Moreover, there is a gap in how IT staff and control system staff understand information security. Furthermore, cross-functional teams need to be created to ensure a holistic view during the incident response process. To improve the capacity for responding to incidents, organizations need regular training sessions and systematic evaluations after such sessions. There is also the potential for improvement in evaluating minor incidents. A transition from an ad hoc approach to a systematic approach in training and learning requires a reorientation not only by the electric power companies but also by management. We found that learning to learn will enable the organizations to improve their incident response practices. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Railway accident prediction is of great significance for establishing an early warning mechanism and preventing the occurrences of accidents. Safety agencies rely on prediction models to design railroad risk management strategies. Based on historical railway accident data, an ensemble learning strategy for accident prediction is proposed. Firstly, an improved K-nearest neighbors (KNN) data imputation algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of missing data in the dataset. Then, to reduce the impact of imbalanced data on prediction performance, an AdaBoost-Bagging method is presented. Finally, according to the feature importance in the prediction model, accident features are ranked to identify new insights into the cause of the accident. The AdaBoost-Bagging prediction method is applied to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) dataset. The application results show that, compared with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), XGBoost, GBDT, Stacking and AdaBoost methods, AdaBoost-Bagging method has a smaller prediction error and faster inference time in predicting railway accidents. Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1–score are 0.879, 0.879, 0.883 and 0.881 respectively, and the inference time is reduced by 23.38%, 12.15%, 6.66%, 3.17% and 11.41% respectively. The prediction method can well mine important features of railway accidents without knowing the accident mechanism or the relationship between various railway accidents and factors, e.g., the critic risk factors related to derailment and collision accidents are investigated in the prediction. The findings will be helpful to the prevention and management of railway accidents. {\textcopyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {In autonomous cars, the automation systems assume complete operational control. In this situation, it is essential that passengers always feel comfortable with the vehicle's decisions. In this project, we are specifically interested in risk assessment by the passenger of an autonomous car navigating among pedestrians in a shared space. A driving simulator experiment was conducted with 27 participants. The challenge was twofold: on the one hand, to find a link between the pedestrians' avoidance behavior of the vehicle and the risk felt by the passenger; and on the other hand, to try to predict this perceived risk in real time. The study revealed a significant effect of two factors on the risk assessed by the participants: (1) the value of the TTC at the moment the vehicle begins a pedestrian avoidance maneuver; (2) the lateral distance it leaves to the pedestrian. The proposed real-time prediction model is based on the principle of impulse response operation. This new paradigm assumes that the passenger's risk assessment is the result of a quantifiable unconscious internal phenomenon that has been estimated using the dynamics of the perceived pedestrian approach. The results showed that this approach was predictive of risk for isolated avoidance maneuvers, but was insufficient to explain the variability in the risk assessment behavior of the participants. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Cyber defense today relies heavily on teams of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), e.g., Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs). Although simple tasks can be automated or scripted, complex decision processes-increasingly needed to counter cyber threats-require SME insight and manual execution. As a result, cyber-defense operations tend to emphasize collection and archiving of data over real-time decision making and response, postponing actionable analysis and response until later, where 'later' is frequently 'too late.' In contrast, adversaries are readily using automation tools to minimize manual work and encapsulate autonomous behaviors into botnets and viruses that adapt to changing conditions. This imbalance puts the adversary in a position of advantage, a situation the research presented in this paper aims to remedy. The scarcity of cyber SMEs and the high cost of involving them in manual cyber responses are among the main factors contributing to the imbalance. The approach we describe aims to reduce the reliance on human SMEs, drive down the cost, and increase the effectiveness of CPTs by capturing expert knowledge in a tool that will automate the identification of known and unknown threats and the launching of mitigations to counter ongoing attacks at system speeds. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

In every probabilistic risk, safety or maintenance analysis, human reliability does act as an effective aspect to assess implications of various aspects of the human performance. But the main constraint with various human reliability analysismethods is in judging the important human performance influencing factors. Because of high degree of uncertainty and variability that characterizes the plantmaintenance environment, it is proposed to use the soft computing technique of fuzzy cognitivemaps in exploring the importance of performance shaping factors inmaintenance scenario. For this purpose, themaintenance environment ismodeled in terms of factors affecting human reliability using cognitive maps.

The “defence in depth” (D-in-D) concept is outlined. Some designing issues of the alarm system (AS) with regard to human factors to be supported using the human reliability analysis (HRA) are discussed. The AS and decision support system (DSS), when properly designed, would contribute to decreasing the human error probability (HEP) in various abnormal situations of the plant. The aim of research undertaken is to develop the methods and software tools consisting of the risk models and probabilistic models with relevant data and knowledge bases for computer aided assessment of human factors in performing HRA as well as optimizing the architectures of safetyrelated systems. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract = {Construction engineering activity requires decision making that involves a relatively large number of risk factors. These factors are related not only to the statistical variability of design data and model uncertainties but also to human proneness to commit errors. Human errors are inevitable and have a significant influence on the safety of building structures, which has been confirmed by the results of numerous structural failure analyses. This influence is also mentioned in the European Standard EN 1990, but human errors are not considered in the partial factor design. In this respect, the reliability required for the structure is achieved by applying quality management measures in design, execution, use and maintenance. The correct operation of the quality control system is then essential for the operational safety of the structure and the economic efficiency of the entire business project. This issue is illustrated with an analysis of the steel structure of an agricultural building in which human errors occurred at the planning, design and execution stages. Owing to the incorrect application of the quality management system, these errors had not been revised in due time, which led to the initiation of legal proceedings and finally to the decision to dismantle the building before putting it into use.},

abstract = {The NASA/APL Parker Solar Probe (PSP) mission will revolutionize our understanding of the Sun by swooping to within 4 million miles of the Sun's surface. This mission targets the fundamental processes and dynamics that characterize the Sun's corona and outwardly expanding solar wind and will be the first mission to fly into the low solar corona (i.e., the Sun's atmosphere) revealing both how the corona is heated and how the solar wind is accelerated. PSP has many engineering challenges presented by the intense environment in terms of heat, solar radiation, and reaction time to 'safe' the spacecraft (displayed in Figures 1 and 2). The fault management system is highly autonomous and is designed to manage the complex system robustness as well as manage fault detection and response in a timely manner. The fault management design relies heavily on the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) which uses a systematic approach to determine the effects of each potential failure mode on that particular component/system, the spacecraft, and the mission. Once the potential effects are determined, then each failure mode is assigned a severity level, commensurate with the potential effects. For the PSP mission, the spacecraft functional FMEA was expanded to also include information about whether or not a failure mode was detectable by the spacecraft or by personnel on the ground, the timeframe for detection, and what mitigation was available to the mission team, if any. The Fault Management Team then used the FMEA to ensure that all faults had been captured, identify which faults could be detected by the spacecraft, and to build appropriate responses for the spacecraft to take during the mission. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

abstract = {In order to effectively control the risk of unsafe acts of air traffic controllers, a risk control system model of the unsafe acts of controllers was constructed by using system dynamics, and the effectiveness of the control strategies was analyzed by simulation. Based on Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) model, the causal relationship between environmental factors, organizational influences, safety supervision, adverse states of controllers and the risk of unsafe acts of controllers was analyzed, and the flow diagram was drawn. The validity of the model was verified by the validity test. The risk level of controller errors and violations was simulated and analyzed from organization influence, safety supervision and combination. The results show that the model can simulate the effectiveness of the control strategies. In the risk control of the controllers' errors and violations, the control effect of combined strategy is the best, in which improving the rules and standards and strengthening safety education and training are the best strategies. Using system dynamics to build the risk control system model of unsafe acts of controllers can simulate and analyze the effectiveness of control strategies, and provide theoretical basis for controlling the risk of unsafe acts of controllers. {\textcopyright} 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This results in tremendous amounts of rich user-generated data. These data provide opportunities for researchers and service providers to study and better understand users' behaviors and further improve the quality of the personalized services. Publishing user-generated data risks exposing individuals' privacy. Users privacy in social media is an emerging research area and has attracted increasing attention recently. These works study privacy issues in social media from the two different points of views: identification of vulnerabilities and mitigation of privacy risks. Recent research has shown the vulnerability of user-generated data against the two general types of attacks, identity disclosure and attribute disclosure. These privacy issues mandate social media data publishers to protect users' privacy by sanitizing user-generated data before publishing it. Consequently, various protection techniques have been proposed to anonymize user-generated social media data. There is vast literature on privacy of users in social media from many perspectives. In this survey, we review the key achievements of user privacy in social media. In particular, we review and compare the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the privacy leakage attacks and anonymization algorithms. We overview the privacy risks from different aspects of social media and categorize the relevant works into five groups: (1) social graphs and privacy, (2) authors in social media and privacy, (3) profile attributes and privacy, (4) location and privacy, and (5) recommendation systems and privacy. We also discuss open problems and future research directions regarding user privacy issues in social media.},

abstract = {Improvement of business processes, increasing customer satisfaction, and reducing organizational costs are important issues that institutions deal with. In this context, six sigma methodology has been considered as a systematic approach to achieve these goals by many organizations. In recent years, non-industrial sectors, where human data are involved, have also applied this technique to improve their processes quality. For application of six sigma procedure for non-industrial issues, there are several challenges that are not encountered in the conventional implementation of Six Sigma procedure. Most of these challenges are experienced on gathering the human (operators, experts) expressed data required for the six sigma projects on the phase of measurement and analysis. The challenges identification and analysis give the ability to address them and provide practical solutions. In this study, in addition to different stages of the Six Sigma methodology, its implementation has been investigated in the non-industrial sector in the DMAIC phases. The challenges dealt with in this research include the impact of external factors on human data, limitations in the design of experiments for human data, qualitative data and discrete data as well as one-sided data. Also, considering a case study on the implementation of six sigma methodology to enhance customer satisfaction in an East Azerbaijan Gas company, strategies are presented for overcoming these obstacles.

abstract = {A quasi-induced exposure approach was applied to the Spanish Register of Traffic Crashes to identify driver- and vehicle-related factors associated with the risk of causing a road crash involving a cyclist in Spain from 1993 to 2009. We analyzed 19,007 collisions between a bicycle and another vehicle in which only one of the drivers committed an infraction, and 13,540 records that included the group of non-infractor cyclists in the above collisions plus cyclists involved in single-bicycle crashes. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated for being responsible for each type of crash for each factor considered. Age from 10 to 19 years, male sex, alcohol or drug consumption and non-helmet use were cyclist-related variables associated with a higher risk of crash, whereas cycling more than 1 h increased only the risk of single crashes. Bicycles with brake defects and ridden by two occupants were also at higher risk of involvement in a crash, whereas light defects were associated only with collisions with another vehicle. For drivers of the other vehicle, age more than 60 years, alcohol, not using safety devices and nonprofessional drivers were at higher risk. The risk of colliding with a bicycle was higher for mopeds than for passenger cars. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To gain deeper insights into this question, we conducted an online study (N = 488) of people's privacy decision-making as well as their levels of privacy awareness toward diverse IoT service scenarios. Statistical analysis on the collected data confirmed that people who are well aware of potential privacy risks in a scenario tend to make more conservative and confident privacy decisions. Machine learning (ML) experiments also revealed that individuals overall privacy awareness is the most important feature when predicting their privacy decisions. We verified that ML models trained on privacy decisions made with confidence can produce highly accurate privacy recommendations for users (area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 87%). Based on these findings, we propose functional requirements for privacy-aware systems to facilitate well-informed privacy decision-making in IoT, which results in conservative and confident decisions that enjoy high consistency.},

Coal mining has been viewed as an inherently high-risk industry in China and there is little doubt that human error contributes to the majority of the accidents. In order to find the hidden failures occurring at the blunt end of a system which leads to the sharp end of human error, 107 coal mining accidents spanning the year of 2007 to 2012 were reviewed and a theoretical framework (the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System, HFACS) was adopted as a means of identifying errors associated with accidents in China. Overall, HFACS proved useful in categorizing errors from existing accident reports and in capturing the full range of relevant human factors data. The study also showed that lack of tailored practice training and procedures for the job can easily trigger operators' unsafe acts and if supervision ability was poor, these unsafe acts could not be identified and controlled. A poor technical environment and poor communication climate are other triggers of operators' unsafe acts; they are further causal factors resulting from a poor organizational process.},

Hence, this work aimed to identify those HFs which affect the SSMS from the most to the least significant, through the impact rate of these factors on workers S-RB at workplaces of twenty-one power plants (PPs), including Fossil Fuel Power Plants (FFPPs) and Onshore Wind Farms (OWFs) that are located across nine countries. Likewise, to give adequate countermeasures for the SSMS enhancement and accidents prevention. To do so, the data were collected through the survey questionnaire of a five-point Likert scale. The study has led us to conclude that, all the analyzed HFs have influenced the SSMS of all the evaluated PPs with an impact rate of 3.3/5 on Likert scale. Whereas the enhancement of the SSMS can be achieved if the job factors are improved and if the employees' “Workload” is well managed at the workplace, as well as if the management clearly demonstrates their H&S commitment and leadership. {\textcopyright} 2020 WITPress.

abstract = {In the common European legislation, the Railway Safety Directive (2004/49/EC) requires the railway companies operating in the EU Member States to manage risks systematically. They are doing this, following amongst others the requirements described in the "Regulation (EC) No 352/2009 of 24 April 2009 on the adoption of a common safety method on risk evaluation and assessment" (shortly: "CSM Regulation"). The CSM Regulation describes a risk management process and framework. The demonstration of compliance with this process, which is accompanied by a report of an assessment body, is a prerequisite for a mutual recognition of the respective process application. According to the CSM Regulation, when assessing a significant change to the railway system, one or more so-called "risk acceptance principles" can be used in order to come upon risk acceptance. One of these principles, which are defined in the Regulation, is the usage of explicit risk estimation. It can be qualitative, quantitative, or "mixed". Already while the first draft of the CSM Regulation was being prepared, it became clear that for the usage of this risk acceptance principle, explicit Risk Acceptance Criteria, would need to be defined and harmonised at a European level. One such criterion was included already in the CSM Regulation. The others were appointed to be included in the upcoming revision(s) of the Regulation. The first stage of the development of the needed harmonised Risk Acceptance Criteria led to a proposal, which excludes all sorts of human contribution to the risks, which were addressed. As a second stage, the hard topic of the risks linked with human activities will have to be developed. This article describes main findings, challenges, questions and discussions related to the development of a proposal for Risk Acceptance Criteria for risks related to human interactions within the railway system.},

abstract = {For several years, security experts and government officials have been warning about a “Cyber Pearl Harbor” – a cyber attack on the nation's power grid. Current cyber security research focuses on the tactical aspects of infrastructure attacks and views attackers as passive agents, downplaying their strategies. The research only minimally incorporates the human element, which limits the understanding of cyber attacks on the critical infrastructure. This paper explores attacker decision-making with regard to power grid cyber attacks from a criminological perspective. It presents the findings from a survey that explored the technical and non-technical factors influencing attacker decision-making. A total of 330 participants from the ethical hacker community and the power industry were surveyed. Nine factors influencing attacker decision-making emerged and were organized to create the PARE RISKS framework: prevention measures (P); attacks and alliances (A); result (R); ease of access (E); response (R); interconnectedness and interdependencies (I); security testing and audits (S); knowledge and research (K); and system weaknesses (S). This paper makes the case that infrastructure attackers are intelligent, active actors who plan strategic attacks and adapt to their environments. The paper also offers recommendations for cyber security policy, focusing on improved security practices, education programs and mandatory security budgets. {\textcopyright} IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

Prior work has suggested that this vulnerability may be addressed with the design of social SP interfaces, such that groups of individuals might work together on behalf of one another to manage SP threats collectively. To this end, we present findings from a qualitative inquiry conducted with older adults and members of technology-rich middle-income households in urban India, where technology users have been shown to engage in relatively more social SP practices. Our research examines the collaborative behaviors enacted by different members of the household for protection from SP threats. In particular, we show how self-appointed family technology managers straddle the line between stewardship and paternalism in their efforts to protect older adults from perceived digital threats. We also offer design implications for supporting collaborative cybersecurity within households based on the insights derived from our analysis.},

However, the traditional security threats have become a source of constant fear and costly to individuals and organizations. Security experts have explored the intertwined role of technology and human behavior concerning security protection actions. This research offers an integrated model building on existing theories such as Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), Health Behavior Model (HBM), and Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM). We address the impact of the users' awareness of security threats on their protective actions while taking into consideration the mediation influence of fear. We also examine moderation effects of intrinsic as well as extrinsic factors such as users' perception of self-efficacy and the benefits and barriers of protective actions respectively. Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) is used to measure the proposed mediation and moderation effects. Our integrated theoretical model evolves around the assumption that security protection actions are formed by complex human behavior, rather than mere deployment of protective technology. The proposed model will be tested on data gathered from the US and Europe targeted population. This context-specific dimension will allow examination of cultural differences between US and Europe. Our results may shed light on the problem that despite advances in security protection technology, the deployment of such technologies is governed by human behavior and influenced by cultural background of the individuals. {\textcopyright} 2016.},

abstract = {COVID-19 has forced many schools and universities worldwide, including Saudi Arabia, to move from traditional face-to-face learning to online learning. Most online learning activities involve the use of video conferencing apps to facilitate synchronous learning sessions. While some faculty members were not accustomed to using video conferencing apps, they had no other choice than to jump on board regardless of their readiness, one of which involved security and privacy awareness. On the other hand, video conferencing apps users face a number of security and privacy threats and vulnerabilities, many of which rely on human factors to be exploited. In this study, we used survey data from 307 faculty members at 43 Saudi Arabian universities to determine the level of awareness among Saudi Arabian faculty regarding security and privacy settings of video conferencing apps and to investigate the factors associated with it. We analyzed the data using the Knowledge-Attitudes-Behaviors (KAB) model and the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method. We found that the average awareness score of video conferencing apps' security and privacy settings falls into the “Poor” category, which is not surprising considering that many faculty members only started using this new technology on a daily basis because of the pandemic. Further analysis showed that perceived security, familiarity with the app, and digital literacy of faculty members are significantly associated with higher awareness. Privacy concerns are significantly associated with higher awareness only among STEM faculty members, while attitudes toward ICT for teaching and research are negatively associated with such awareness among senior faculty members with more than 10 years of experience. This study lays the foundation for future research and user education on the security and privacy settings of video conferencing applications. {\textcopyright} 2022. Alammary et al.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the shipping industry has implemented a number of measures aimed at improving its safety level (such as new regulations or new forms of team training). Despite this evolution, shipping accidents, and particularly collisions, remain a major concern. This paper presents a modified version of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System, which has been adapted to the maritime context and used to analyse human and organisational factors in collisions reported by the Marine Accident and Investigation Branch (UK) and the Transportation Safety Board (Canada). The analysis shows that most collisions are due to decision errors. At the precondition level, it highlights the importance of the following factors: poor visibility and misuse of instruments (environmental factors), loss of situation awareness or deficit of attention (conditions of operators), deficits in inter-ship communications or Bridge Resource Management (personnel factors). At the leadership level, the analysis reveals the frequent planning of inappropriate operations and non-compliance with the Safety Management System (SMS). The Multiple Accident Analysis provides an important finding concerning three classes of accidents. Inter-ship communications problems and Bridge Resource Management deficiencies are closely linked to collisions occurring in restricted waters and involving pilot-carrying vessels. Another class of collisions is associated with situations of poor visibility, in open sea, and shows deficiencies at every level of the socio-technical system (technical environment, condition of operators, leadership level, and organisational level). The third class is characterised by non-compliance with the SMS. This study shows the importance of Bridge Resource Management for situations of navigation with a pilot on board in restricted waters. It also points out the necessity to investigate, for situations of navigation in open sea, the masters' decisions in critical conditions as well as the causes of non-compliance with SMS. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To address the challenges triggered by these diverse risks, this research identifies the basic factors that could enhance the resilience of the port system. After these factors are identified and expressed as different resilience capacities, they are used to quantify the resilience of the port infrastructure by applying a Bayesian network. Quantification of resilience is further analyzed based on different advanced techniques such as forward propagation, backward propagation, sensitivity analysis, and information theory. The formal interpretation of these analyses indicates that maintenance, alternate routing, and manpower restoration are the leading factors contributing to enhancing the resilience of a port infrastructure system under disruptive conditions. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Autonomous systems operation will in the foreseeable future rely on the interaction between software, hardware and humans. Efficient interaction and communication between these agents are crucial for safe operation. Conventional methods for hazard identification and safety assessment focus often on one of the aspects of the system only, e.g., human reliability, software failures, or equipment reliability. The method Human-System Interaction in Autonomy (H-SIA) was recently proposed, focusing on autonomous ships operation and collision scenarios. H-SIA provides a framework for analyzing autonomous ship operation as an entirety, rather than each agent separately. The method comprised initially of two main elements: An Event Sequence Diagram (ESD) and a Concurrent Task Analysis (CoTA). While the ESD models the events that can take place following an initiating event, the CoTA models which tasks the agents must perform for these events to succeed. This paper extends H-SIA to include the paths to failure, through the development of Fault Trees (FTs), which is necessary for risk analysis and identification of risk reduction measures. The FTs development of H-SIA introduces novelties in comparison to common FTs: (i) they model the system as whole, (ii) they are generic and can accommodate a diversity of systems designs; (iii) they lead to basic failure events. The FTs allows for identification of failure events arising through interaction between autonomous ship and human operators, as well as failure propagation through these agents. The basic failure events are applicable for different autonomous concepts. A case study on autonomous ship collision demonstrates the use of the extended method.

abstract = {Flawed TLS certificates are not uncommon on the Internet. While they signal a potential issue, in most cases they have benign causes (e.g., misconfiguration or even deliberate deployment). This adds fuzziness to the decision on whether to trust a connection or not. Little is known about perceptions of flawed certificates by IT professionals, even though their decisions impact high numbers of end users. Moreover, it is unclear how much the content of error messages and documentation influences these perceptions. To shed light on these issues, we observed 75 attendees of an industrial IT conference investigating different certificate validation errors. We also analyzed the influence of reworded error messages and redesigned documentation. We find that people working in IT have very nuanced opinions, with trust decisions being far from binary. The self-signed and the name-constrained certificates seem to be over-trusted (the latter also being poorly understood). We show that even small changes in existing error messages can positively influence resource use, comprehension, and trust assessment. At the end of the article, we summarize lessons learned from conducting usable security studies with IT professionals.},

abstract = {Keystroke behaviour-based authentication employs the unique typing behaviour of users to authenticate them. Recent such proposals for virtual keyboards on smartphones employ diverse temporal, contact, and spatial features to achieve over 95% accuracy. Consequently, they have been suggested as a second line of defense with text-based password authentication. We show that a state-of-the-art keystroke behaviour-based authentication scheme is highly vulnerable against mimicry attacks. While previous research used training interfaces to attack physical keyboards, we show that this approach has limited effectiveness against virtual keyboards. This is mainly due to the large number of diverse features that the attacker needs to mimic for virtual keyboards. We address this challenge by developing an augmented reality-based app that resides on the attacker's smartphone and leverages computer vision and keystroke data to provide real-time guidance during password entry on the victim's phone. In addition, we propose an audiovisual attack in which the attacker overlays transparent film printed with spatial pointers on the victim's device and uses audio cues to match the temporal behaviour of the victim. Both attacks require neither tampering or installing software on the victim's device nor specialized hardware. We conduct experiments with 30 users to mount over 400 mimicry attacks. We show that our methods enable an attacker to mimic keystroke behaviour on virtual keyboards with little effort. We also demonstrate the extensibility of our augmented reality-based technique by successfully mounting mimicry attacks on a swiping behaviour-based continuous authentication system.},

abstract = {The I-Voting system designed and implemented in Estonia is one of the first nationwide Internet voting systems. Since its creation, it has been met with praise but also with close scrutiny. Concerns regarding security breaches have focused on in-person election observations, code reviews and adversarial testing on system components. These concerns have led many to conclude that there are various ways in which insider threats and sophisticated external attacks may compromise the integrity of the system and thus the voting process. In this paper, we examine the procedural components of the I-Voting system, with an emphasis on the controls related to procedural security mechanisms, and on system-transparency measures. Through an approach grounded in primary and secondary data sources, including interviews with key Estonian election personnel, we conduct an initial investigation into the extent to which the present controls mitigate the real security risks faced by the system. The experience and insight we present in this paper will be useful both in the context of the I-Voting system, and potentially more broadly in other voting systems. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

Design/methodology/approach – Five human factors and nine attacks are considered to investigate their relationship. A field research is conducted on Greek employees in higher education to identify the human factors that affect information security. The sample is consisted of 103 employees that use computers at work. Pearson correlation analysis between lack of awareness and nine (9) computer security risks is performed. Findings – Examining the association of lack of awareness with these attacks that threat the security of computers, all nine factors of important attacks exert significant and positive effect, apart from phishing. Considering the relationship of lack of awareness to human factors, all five human factors used are significantly and positively correlated with lack of awareness. Moreover, all nine important attacks, apart from one, exert a significant and positive effect. Research limitations/implications – The paper extends understanding of the relationship of the human factors, the lack of awareness and information security. The study has focused on employees of the Technological Educational Institute (TEI) of Athens, namely, teachers, administrators and working post-graduate students. Originality/value – The paper has used weighted factors based on data collection in higher education to calculate a global index for lack of awareness, as the result of the weighted aggregation of nine (9) risks, and extends the analysis performed in the literature to evaluate the effectiveness of security awareness in computer risk management. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Furthermore, the domestic subway construction accidents during the period 2008 to 2020 are collected and organized, and among the 130 accidents with complete risk factors are selected to calculate the probability of risk occurrence and risk coupling values under different coupling methods, so that the key risk coupling methods affecting the system vulnerability can be attained by the N-K model. The results show that the more risk factors in the system, the greater the probability of accident occurrence; when the personnel factors, management factors and environmental factors are fully coupled, the vulnerability of the subway construction safety system shall be greater.

abstract = {PSA (Probabilistic Safety Assessment) is an industrial plant approach that has evolved with the complexity of systems. Initially, tools and techniques have been developed with the main purpose of analyzing operational plants, enabling the identification of phenomena and fault mechanisms hitherto not highlighted. With the evolution of accidents studies, some techniques applicable to pre-operational phases were developed in order to reduce the risks in operation. Therefore, a number of techniques adequate to analyze ready or near completion designs can be found. The same is not observed for the early design phase. Despite this, more and more experts in the risk assessment field suggest that safety considerations are most effective when assessed over the whole life of critical systems, including the early stages of its design. These considerations are extended to HRA (Human Reliability Analysis), i.e., there are few tools that consider operational aspects, especially human performance, during the design phase. The recognized contribution of the human factor in accidents involving complex systems - sometimes attributed to the lack of suitable tools for its consideration in the design phase - further highlights this gap. In this context, this paper presents a methodology developed for the early consideration of human reliability in the design of complex systems. It is based on the use of quantitative data from HRA models and expert opinions expressed in published PSAs. The development of this methodology has prioritized the easy understanding of its steps and results, i.e., its intelligibility for people involved in the system design has been sought, with expertise on HRA or not. {\textcopyright} 2015 by the American Nuclear Society.},

Our approach will allow companies to have a much more realistic perception and coloured picture of decision-making, where societal acceptability is fully integrated into the calculation process. This way, the decision will not only be more accurate, but also be more defensible. After a literature review, 11 indicators were identified as relevant within the framework of prevention of disasters in companies. Factor analysis confirmed that the 11 indicators represent a societal acceptability of risks (SAR) concept. By using a scoring system we explain how an adjusted DF∗ can be determined. An illustrative example is also given to show how the model can actually be used.

As a case study, the methodology is applied to the activation of an emergency alarm and considers the consequences introduced because of a harsh environment. The results of the case study show that the probability of success for personnel to become aware of an emergency alarm is most likely affected by noise due to strong wind.

Human factors effect and analysis presents a roadmap for selecting significant human factors affecting maintenance management as well as the most effective solutions using cost–benefit analysis. Safety and operational consequences of each human factor are compared to preventive and recovery risk controls to select the preferred risk control method. Because human factor programs are not implemented in many maintenance departments, quantitative data are rare. Thus, expert judgment may help to compare potential solutions. In order to show the applicability of the proposed approach a power plant in Kenya is selected as a case study. Procedure usage, fatigue, knowledge and experience, and time pressure are identified as the most important human factors. Training, task planning /shift management, knowledge management, scheduling as well as incident report programs are the most cost-effective solutions for performing human factors program.

abstract = {Introduction: The rising popularity of makerspaces and integrated science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education labs has increased the safety/health hazards and resulting potential risks that schools, libraries, community centers, and educators must be prepared to address. Previous studies have demonstrated that adequate safety training can enhance educators' safety perceptions and reduce accident rates. Method: Safety training was conducted in three different U.S. states for 48 educators working in K-12 STEM areas. Differences in the mode of delivery, length of the training, and types of hands-on activities instituted at each training site were examined in relation to the level of influence these factors had on educators' safety perceptions. A modified version of the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI) was used, which had previously been adapted for similar safety studies and showed strong reliability measures. Results: The pre- and post-survey responses revealed that educators at the fully online and shortest training session did not experience significant changes in their safety perceptions. However, participants at the two face-to-face sites demonstrated significant gains in their safety perceptions. Most notably, the site that offered the longest training and integrated the most hands-on lab activities recorded the greatest gains. Additionally, correlational analyses corroborated that as the amount of hands-on activities and length of the trainings increased, there was a positive significant association with changes in educators' safety perceptions. Conclusions: This research helps bridge the gap between industry and K-12 STEM education research regarding better safety training practices. The findings from this study can help promote safer teaching and learning environments, while also reducing liability and the chance of a serious accident. Practical Applications: State departments, higher education institutions, teacher education programs, school districts, and others providing STEM safety training to K-12 educators should utilize this research to reexamine their safety training policies and practices. {\textcopyright} 2022},

abstract = {Both the bowtie method as well as human factors have become increasingly popular topics in risk management. The challenge remains, however, to discover the best way to include human factors in the bowtie method. The study of human factors occupies itself with researching the interaction between the user and his/her working environment. In this white paper two visions will be examined on how and why human factors can be included in the bowtie method. The two visions draw from Hollnagel's System-1 and System-2 thinking. Vision 1 (which is more closely related to Safety-I thinking) is in favor of the idea that human factors can be included as a threat as well as an escalation factor. Vision 2 (which is more closely related to Safety- II thinking) is in favor of the idea that human factors can only be included as an escalation factor. This article concerns itself first and foremost with qualitative bowties and not quantitative bowties, because bowtie thinking is, at its core, scenario-driven. This paper is intended for people who use bowtie modeling in their jobs, but who do not have any background in cognitive psychology. By the end of this white paper, we hope you have gained a better understanding of human factors and how to include these in the bowtie method. {\textcopyright} 2020 AIChE Virtual Spring Meeting and 16th Global Congress on Process Safety.

abstract = {With the increasing amount of interconnections between vehicles, the attack surface of internal vehicle networks is rising steeply. Although these networks are shielded against external attacks, they often do not have any internal security to protect against malicious components or adversaries who can breach the network perimeter. To secure the in-vehicle network, all communicating components must be authenticated, and only authorized components should be allowed to send and receivemessages. This is achieved through the use of an authentication framework. Cryptography is widely used to authenticate communicating parties and provide secure communication channels (e.g., Internet communication). However, the real-time performance requirements of in-vehicle networks restrict the types of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that may be used. In particular, asymmetric cryptography is computationally infeasible during vehicle operation. In this work, we address the challenges of designing authentication protocols for automotive systems. We present Lightweight Authentication for Secure Automotive Networks (LASAN), a full lifecycle authentication approach.We describe the core LASAN protocols and show how they protect the internal vehicle network while complying with the real-time constraints and low computational resources of this domain. By leveraging the fixed structure of automotive networks, we minimize bandwidth and computation requirements. Unlike previous work, we also explain how this framework can be integrated into all aspects of the automotive product lifecycle, including manufacturing, vehicle maintenance, and software updates. We evaluate LASAN in two different ways: First, we analyze the security properties of the protocols using established protocol verification techniques based on formal methods. Second, we evaluate the timing requirements of LASAN and compare these to other frameworks using a new highly modular discrete event simulator for in-vehicle networks, which we have developed for this evaluation.},

With perennial pressure for becoming faster, safer & better with every passing day, greatest challenge for the industry is to eliminate & manage all possible risks to ensure an incident/accident free operation to meet the growing demand of the society. Modern society cannot be conceived without an efficient & safe transport system. Amongst all modes of transport, rail transportation occupies a unique place being the bulk carrier of people & cargo at an affordable cost with least adverse impact on environment. Despite massive modernization & induction of state of are technology, the safety of rail-road transportation depends largely on the operator. A railway accident always makes a big news across societies & has a particular impact on the psyche of public. There is always a cause most of the time trivial. The bright side of railway accidents that all misfortune has been turned to profit with evolution of technology based on the lessons learnt. In fact, the modernization of railways so far has greatly depended & progressed on the accident investigation knowledge. Railways growth since its evolution almost two centuries ago is nothing short of a revolutionary technical adventure unique in human history. In the paper a comprehensive study of all human factor issues involved in working of employees at sharp end of safety has been attempted with critical analysis of more than 1200 incidents/accidents over a period of decades in Indian Railways. The study revealed many hidden areas & contributing factors in lowering the human performance limit, leading to unsafe acts & unpredicted tragic accidents/incidents. Many findings have belied the traditional knowledge, belief & logic. The knowledge emerging from this study may help develop counter measures against risks in all transport sectors which may accrue immense societal benefit. Further study could be undertaken by researchers, academician, administrators and regulators in greater public interest. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Although major hazard industries have no legal obligations to demonstrate a good safety culture, it is an increasingly important factor for risk-based inspections. This paper describes the development and evaluation of a relatively simple method for external indicative assessment of the process safety culture in major hazard industries. As a first step, a tool was developed. Second, the tool was successfully tested in a workshop with major hazard inspectors. After this ‘proof of concept' and a few adaptations to improve the tool, quantitative evaluation and validation were carried out with a representative sample of major hazard inspectors in the Netherlands. In this stage, the tool comprised 30 questions, of which 19 sufficiently frequent valid responses were given for the validity test. The evaluations demonstrate that without specific preparations, inspection teams can use the tool to discriminate between plants with poor or good safety cultures. That is sufficient for ranking as additional input for risk-based inspection strategies. The resulting indicative ‘scores' for safety culture correlate meaningfully with the quality of process safety management systems and the number of (legal) non-compliances, which were identified by the inspection team at the same occasion. The use of the tool can be further improved by training inspectors, making minor adaptations of the inspection process, and broadening the scope of a few questions. It is expected that external assessments of safety culture will become increasingly important not only for inspectorates, but also for a range of other external stakeholders. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Cloud computing promises essential improvements in healthcare delivery performance. However, its wide adoption in healthcare is yet to be seen, one main reason being patients' concerns for security and privacy of their sensitive medical records. These concerns can be addressed through corresponding security and privacy requirements within the system engineering process. Despite a plethora of related research, security and privacy requirements for cloud systems and services have seldomly been investigated methodically so far, whereas their individual priorities to increase the system success probability have been neglected. Against this background, this study applies a systematic requirements engineering process: First, based on a systematic literature review, an extensive initial set of security and privacy requirements is elicited. Second, an online survey based on the best-worst scaling method is designed, conducted, and evaluated to determine priorities of security and privacy requirements. Our results show that confidentiality and integrity of medical data are ranked at the top of the hierarchy of prioritized requirements, followed by control of data use and modification, patients' anonymity, and patients' control of access rights. Availability, fine-grained access control, revocation of access rights, flexible access, clinicians' anonymity, as well as usability, scalability, and efficiency of the system complete the ranking. The level of agreement among patients is rather small, but statistically significant at the 0.01 level. The main contribution of the present research comprises the study method and results highlighting the role of strong security and privacy and excluding any trade-offs with system usability. Enabling a richer understanding of patients' security and privacy requirements for adopting cloud computing in healthcare, these are of particular importance to researchers and practitioners interested in supporting the process of security and privacy engineering for health-cloud solutions. It further represents a supplement that can support time-intensive negotiation meetings between the requirements engineers and patients.},

abstract = {Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are primarily known for their positive impact in improving the safety of drivers. Previous studies primarily analyzed the positive effects of ADAS with short-term experiments and accident data without considering the long-term changes in drivers' safety perception. The human factor is the most dominant among factors that cause traffic accidents, and safety effect evaluation should be performed considering changes in human errors. To this end, this study classified the safety effect of ADAS-forward collision warning (FCW) on taxi drivers in Seoul into behavioral control and attitude change to perform analysis on respective factors. With regard to behavioral control, virtual driving simulation was used to analyze the reaction time of drivers and deceleration rate, and for attitude change, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series analysis was employed to predict the long-term perception change of drivers. The analysis results indicated that, in terms of behavioral control, ADAS-FCW reduces the cognitive reaction time of drivers in risk situations on the road, similar to the findings in previous studies. However, in terms of attitude change, ADAS-FCW has the adverse long-term effect of increasing violations in maintaining safety distance in the case of nighttime-drivers under 60 years old. As can be seen from these results, new technologies in the road safety arena can have a short-term effect of improving safety with behavioral control but may have a negative impact in the long term. The results of this study are expected to provide a theoretical basis for reference in the safety evaluation of ADAS and traffic safety facilities. {\textcopyright} 2021 by the authors.

Though issues of cost and stringent marketing deadlines have been resolved in such a methodology, yet the root of hardware trust has been evicted. Malicious circuitry, a.k.a. Hardware Trojan Horse (HTH), is inserted by adversaries in the less trusted phases of design. A HTH remains dormant during testing but gets triggered at runtime to cause sudden active and passive attacks. In this work, we focus on the runtime passive threats based on the parameter delay. Nature-inspired algorithms offer an alternative to the conventional techniques for solving complex problems in the domain of computer science. However, most are optimization techniques and none is dedicated to security. We seek refuge to the crypsis behavior exhibited by geckos in nature to generate a runtime security technique for SoC architectures, which can bypass runtime passive threats of a HTH. An adaptive security intellectual property (IP) that works on the proposed security principles is designed. Embedded timing analysis is used for experimental validation. Low area and power overhead of our proposed security IP over standard benchmarks and practical crypto SoC architectures as obtained in experimental results supports its applicability for practical implementations.},

In parallel, technological platforms were deployed in order to share crime-related information with the public and to support the development of problem-solving strategies. However, the impact of these initiatives in terms of crime reduction and perception has not been sufficiently investigated yet. Furthermore, up to now, no previous studies compared the effectiveness between the traditional approach of preventive patrolling and technology-based crime prevention solutions. Therefore, we present a study design which aims at assessing the effectiveness of the two aforementioned crime prevention measures. The goal is to evaluate and compare their effects over the local criminal activity and citizen's safety perception measured by Fear of Crime (FOC) and Perceived Risk of Victimization (PRV) constructs. Preliminary results show a rather low level of FOC across the whole sample, paired by a high level of PRV. Furthermore, potential explanatory background factors for the previous constructs have been identified and will be explored in future work.},

The uncoupled variability has drawn rare attention, despite its vital importance in major accidents analysis as per Safety-I and Safety-II paradigms. Accordingly, as the first attempt, this study proposes a systematic model to analyze performance variability in human, organizational, and technology-oriented functions caused by various variability shaping factors (VSFs). The model contains three main phases. First, a FRAM (Functional Resonance Analysis Method) - driven Human-Organization-Technology Taxonomy is developed. Subsequently, Dempster - Shafer Evidence theory is employed to elicit knowledge under epistemic uncertainty. The proposed causation model is integrated into Dynamic Bayesian Networks to support decision-making under aleatory uncertainty. Finally, a criticality matrix is developed to evaluate the performance of the system functions to support decision-making. The proposed model is built considering the advanced canonical probabilistic approaches (e.g., Noisy Max and Leaky models) that address the critical challenges of incomplete and imprecise data. The proposed dynamic model would help better understand, analyze, and improve the safety performance of complex sociotechnical systems. {\textcopyright} 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers},

These vulnerabilities have been exploited in real life and caused damages to related stakeholders such as program users. As many security vulnerabilities belong to program code, many techniques have been applied to mitigate these vulnerabilities before program deployment. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive comparative analysis of different vulnerability mitigation works. As a result, there exists an obscure mapping between the techniques, the addressed vulnerabilities, and the limitations of different approaches. This article attempts to address these issues. The work extensively compares and contrasts the existing program security vulnerability mitigation techniques, namely testing, static analysis, and hybrid analysis. We also discuss three other approaches employed to mitigate the most common program security vulnerabilities: secure programming, program transformation, and patching. The survey provides a comprehensive understanding of the current program security vulnerability mitigation approaches and challenges as well as their key characteristics and limitations.

abstract = {The nature of risks is ambiguity, diversity and multilayer for the complicated artificial system which is composed by engineering systems and human organization. An idea of how to organize a new risk analysis system is proposed in this paper by applying IAEA's five-layer Defense-in Depth (DiD) safety concept. Concretely, a method of how to configure integrated DiD risk analysis system is proposed to cope with the capability of treating complex nature of risks of various levels and modes in the behavior of the artificial system effectively. Application of the proposed idea will be conducted in future by an example practice of how to design distributed human interface system (HIS) for the support of safety operation of nuclear power plant. {\textcopyright} 2018},

abstract = {National and international efforts under the initiative 'patient safety' aim for more safety and transparency within healthcare systems for both patients and professionals. Within the healthcare sector, workflows become more and more complex, while time and money become scarce. As the consequence, the risk awareness, fault management and quality aspects in general become more important. One of the most established risk assessment methods is Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) - a reliability analysis and risk assessment tool widely used in various industries. The traditional FMEA is using a Risk Priority Number (RPN) ranking system to evaluate and identify the risk level of failures, and to prioritize actions. However, there are shortcomings in obtaining a quality estimate of the failure ratings with FMEA, especially when human factors play a role, as it is in healthcare. Thus, a new risk assessment method named HFdFMEA (Human Factor dependent FMEA) based on dependency of used parameters and observation of human factors, is proposed to address these drawbacks. The results of this paper show that the HFdFMEA does not only increase risk level of failures based on the inclusion of human-factors but also gives the possibility to reduce the risk level of failures through means of addressing human-factors via trainings, motivation, etc. Finally, we discuss the opportunity to improve patient safety as result of the proposed HFdFMEA, used as technique for Human-Factor-based Risk Management (RiDeM). {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

abstract = {The main challenge that can impact the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms is human error (unintentional threats). Irrational judgment associated with human error is often linked to a unique attribute called cognitive bias (CB). CB is a tendency to think irrationally in certain situations and make irrational judgment. The appearance of CB in human decisions is considered one of the implications of system usability. In the security filed, usability is recognized as one of the main issues that affect an individual's security decisions. Clearly, security decision-making is a result of three overlapping factors: security, usability and CB. In this paper, we quantify security decision making by providing a holistic view on how these factors affect the security decision. For this purpose, an experiment was conducted involving 54 participants who performed multiple security tasks related to authentication. An eye-tracking machine was used to record cognitive measurements that were used for decision analysis. Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach was then used to evaluate the participants' decisions. The result showed that participants security decisions are varied depends on the authentication method. For instance, picture type was the authentication method least influenced by CB. Low system usability is one of the major causes of CB in decisions. This was not the case for the picture password method. The different levels of usability associated with the picture method resulted in low impact of CB on participants' security decision. This finding point to investigating how picture-based authentication methods are capable of handling the issue of the CB. {\textcopyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract = {Statistics have shown that the main reason for traffic accidents is human error. Modern vehicles are equipped to protect occupants in the event of a crash. The latest advanced vehicles come with driver behavior monitoring systems in recent years, and many have been proven to be effective systems in the prevention of accidents. However, these systems do not provide a complete solution and can only detect driver fatigue or driver distraction. This project aims to build an AI model for sensing the distraction of drivers and identifying the kind of distraction using the Kinect sensor and the Brio camera and reorient driver's attention on driving. For this, the system is divided into three sub-segments; calling arm position (arms up or down, arms right or left), facial expressions (blinking and mouth), and head orientation. Each segment develops important info for gauging the distraction of a driver based on the depth mapping of data and color from the Kinect sensor and Brio camera respectively. Testing on a driving simulator is completed on 4 different drivers of diverse ethnicity, sex, and age along with over 240 mins of recorded material. Since all the segments were recorded and prepared separately, they can further be taken to build different outcomes and can be implemented for real car systems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 ASME},

abstract = {Older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. To date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. Instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. To do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. Community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. Using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. Our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security.},

It can be applied in a broad class of settings, including settings with asynchronous play and partial but incomplete revelation of early moves. Its computational and elicitation requirements are modest. We illustrate the approach with an application to a simple defend-attack model in which the defender's countermeasures are revealed with a probability less than one to the attacker before he decides on how or whether to attack. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.},

abstract = {Violations of rules and procedures are commonly identified as an important causal factor in workplace accidents. Essentially, there are two different types of violations: intentional and unintentional violations. Whereas the former term refers to deliberate violations of rules and procedures that are known and understood by the actor, the latter refers to violations of rules and procedures that the actor has no awareness or knowledge of and therefore operates without any reference to. The vast majority of previous research has been concerned with intentional rather than unintentional violations. This implies that researchers have put a particular focus on the aspects of work that affect workers' safety motivation and their attitudes towards compliant behavior, and that they have been less concerned with the factors that affect workers' knowledge of rules and procedures. On the basis of semi-structured interviews of 24 contract workers within the Norwegian petroleum industry, this research gap is addressed in the present paper. The objective is to identify, categorize and gain a comprehension of the most significant factors that affect workers' knowledge of rules and procedures. Analysis revealed that eight different factors within the workers' organizational context are important. These are sorted into three paramount categories: the safety management system, work characteristics and social interaction. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Faced with the threats posed by man-in-the-middle attacks, messaging platforms rely on "out-of-band" authentication, assuming that users have access to an external channel for authenticating one short value. For example, assuming that users recognizing each other's voice can authenticate a short value, Telegram and WhatApp ask their users to compare 288-bit and 200-bit values, respectively. The existing protocols, however, do not take into account the plausible behavior of users who may be "lazy" and only compare parts of these values (rather than their entirety). Motivated by such a security-critical user behavior, we study the security of lazy users in out-of-band authentication. We start by showing that both the protocol implemented by WhatsApp and the statistically optimal protocol of Naor, Segev, and Smith (CRYPTO'06) are completely vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks when the users consider only a half of the out-of-band authenticated value. In this light, we put forward a framework that captures the behavior and security of lazy users. Our notions of security consider both statistical security and computational security, and for each flavor we derive a lower bound on the tradeoff between the number of positions that are considered by the lazy users and the adversary's forgery probability. Within our framework, we then provide two authentication protocols. First, in the statistical setting, we present a transformation that converts any out-of-band authentication protocol into one that is secure even when executed by lazy users. Instantiating our transformation with a new refinement of the protocol of Naor et al. results in a protocol whose tradeoff essentially matches our lower bound in the statistical setting. Then, in the computational setting, we show that the computationally optimal protocol of Vaudenay (CRYPTO'05) is secure even when executed by lazy users - and its tradeoff matches our lower bound in the computational setting.},

abstract = {The improvement of safety performance of construction workers heavily lies in safety training, and training technologies, materials and organisations. However, the traditional one-size-fit-all safety training does not cater for the needs of heterogeneous workers. Personalised training may proffer a better solution for heterogeneous workers in the construction sector. To understand the rationale of personalised training, this study formulated a learner model that can capture and evaluate the learning abilities of individual workers. Methodically, a survey on 170 construction workers was conducted, and evidenced that they were heterogeneous in safety training motivation, established knowledge, and emotions during the knowledge acquisition process; and were vulnerable to the model effect and convenience effect during the knowledge application process. The results also showed that workers generally perceived safety training as a mandatory requirement, rather than inherently motivated; emotional changes was the most influencing factor in the knowledge acquisition process; about 40% of the workers were strongly vulnerable to the model effect and convenience effect; and 18% of the workers needed to improve their ability of knowledge acquisition and knowledge application. The correlation analysis and t-test indicated that age, year of experience, trade, project type, organisation type and site environment influenced workers' learning characteristics and abilities; which lead to the varied levels of safety understanding, awareness and performance. It was also concluded that the construction workers had unique characteristics in their safety learning process and the concept of adapted safety learning could potentially improve the efficiency of safety training. {\textcopyright} 2019},

Also, the potential damages to the institutions can affect their reputation as a result of the incidents related to the crimes.

Our contribution will take into account all external / internal parameters, external / internal factors, evaluation criteria, attacks, threats and legal standards. The proposed model of physical, IT and communications security management in the case of higher education institutions is based on security barriers, monitored by a qualified security manager, inspired by computer security procedures and which can be on different security levels, but also on parallel security networks. The research consisted on developing three levels of security, correspond to the degree of security that each of the aforementioned departments should benefit from, modifying the internal analysis parameters and factors, thus reducing the security risk and bringing greater security to the education and research process.

abstract = {This work was designed to present to NETWORK Research and Services,a demonstration of the concepts and applications of real cases in Human Factors,Risk,Reliability and Crisis. Although we work with Complex Systems that are difficult to predict (such as the chemical process industries) and understanding the nature of the processes in Sociotechnical Systems,we can build Rules and Barriers that have better results than current ones. Concepts are the basis,tests are confirmation,algorithms indicate associated methods and techniques,and validation indicates the certainty of achieving good results. In the case of Reliability,the concepts and algorithms were tested with real cases from the Oil Industry. The new concepts are systemic failure; cultural force field; socioeconomic and affective utility of the task versus feedback; causal link of low-risk perception; difference between enabling elements of hazard energy versus human factors in the operational situation; management models to avoid accidents and to avoid energy losses and respective techniques that include the discussion about culture and human factors. A discussion of cultural threats of behavior change (example: blame culture and generational conflicts) and application cases indicating solutions to bad habits and incorrect decisions,they make it easier to understand why social risks are dynamic and do not separate from the routine. The human elements are part of the project and cut (disable) the how of dangerous energy. The intention is that these elements of the safety culture and the technological project are safeguards,but it may be that the project is incomplete or that the barriers have suffered social and physical threats,reducing resistance in relation to the load. These elements of the managerial (stress and leadership),technological (risk and complexity) and behavior (4Cs) dimensions will be limiting the passage of energy by human factors (which includes management,culture,organization,and technology). The 9 levels of human factors that will compose the Bayesian network are: Culture,Social Phenomenon,Company,Management & STAFF,Group and Individual,Operational Control,Failure Control,Accident and Crisis or Disaster. The Investigation on the Operational and Technical Culture indicates the formal and informal rules of operation of the team in the Operational Routine,allowing the prediction of the future behavior of the worker,the process,and the equipment from the signs of failure. It is possible to calculate the level of approach of the discomfort zone for safety events from this plant history. For this we use,data mining,grouping,analysis of main components,definition and calculation of the objective function,heuristic rules,and adjustment of factors through fuzzy mechanics. This solution-guiding document addresses events with different stress levels in which the operating team lives: operational deviations,uncontrolled processes,damage on equipment,and task failures,safety events such as fire,and catastrophic events that unfold for crisis. Theoretical models are presented,discussion of human error in emergencies,and proposal of appropriate competence for emergency brigade. The internal and external regulation after these discussions needs to revise its principles to correct the standardization and organizational communication processes,which would change the procedures for team building and the criteria for the technology project. Thus,the discussion on the regulation and formatting of human elements and human factors will clarify technicians and managers as to what should be done. An improvement program that includes researching lessons learned is included in the work. Finally,here technological solutions are suggested in the technological,managerial,social and organizational dimension for the best control of companies.

Based on the experience of a project in the metallurgical industry,we propose interventions to adjust the safety culture.

abstract = {High risk environments such as control rooms are extremely stressful for front line operators because they are solely responsible for ultimate decision making under high task load situations during accidents involving a large complex system. Individuals working as a team constantly interact with each other and therefore introduce team related issues such as coordination, supervision and conflict resolution which are influenced by nontechnical, cognitive and social skills of team members. The aggregate impact of multiple human errors inside communication loops in a team context can give rise to complicated failure modes; thus the reliability of human to human interactions in a safety critical environment is extremely important. This research develops a systematic method to explicitly model the operating crew as a social interactive unit and investigate their dynamic behavior under upset situations through the application of simulation methods. The ultimate goal is to capture and study the effects of team factors and team dynamics on system risk with main focus being on team errors, associated causes and error management processes and their impact on team performance. Meanwhile, team activities such as information collection and sharing, structure of shared mental models, team decision making and combined action execution are modeled and examined. An object based modeling methodology is applied to represent system elements and different roles and behaviors within the operating team. The basic ingredients of the individual operator model are from IDAC (Information, Decision, and Action in Crew context) cognitive model, and scenario generation follows typical DPRA (Dynamic Probabilistic Risk Assessment) methodologies. The approach is applied to simulate the operating crew behavior in response to malfunctions of a four train feed water system as a representation of a larger size plant in order to demonstrate the proposed modeling and simulation capabilities. Different configurations of team characteristics and influencing team factors have been simulated and compared to each other by observing parameters of interest. In addition, this research has developed CREWSIM, a customized library in MATLAB Simulink environment which facilitates the modeling process for similar applications of the methodology. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, London..},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is the review and comparative assessment of infrastructure related crash risk factors, with the explicit purpose of ranking them based on how detrimental they are towards road safety (i.e. crash risk, frequency and severity). This analysis was carried out within the SafetyCube project, which aimed to identify and quantify the effects of risk factors and measures related to behaviour, infrastructure or vehicles, and integrate the results in an innovative road safety Decision Support System (DSS). The evaluation was conducted by examining studies from the existing literature. These were selected and analysed using a specifically designed common methodology. Infrastructure risk factors were structured in a hierarchical taxonomy of 10 areas with several risk factors in each area (59 specific risk factors in total), examples include: alignment features (e.g. horizontal-vertical alignment deficiencies), cross-section characteristics (e.g. superelevation, lanes, median and shoulder deficiencies), road surface deficiencies, workzones, junction deficiencies (interchange and at-grade) etc. Consultation with infrastructure stakeholders (international organisations, road authorities, etc.) took place in dedicated workshops to identify user needs for the DSS, as well as “hot topics” of particular importance. The following analysis methodology was applied to each infrastructure risk factor: (i) A search for relevant international literature, (ii) Selection of studies on the basis of rigorous criteria, (iii) Analysis of studies in terms of design, methods and limitations, (iv) Synthesis of findings - and meta-analysis, when feasible. In total 243 recent and high quality studies were selected and analysed. Synthesis of results was made through 39 ‘Synopses' (including 4 original meta-analyses) on individual risk factors or groups of risk factors. This allowed the ranking of infrastructure risk factors into three groups: risky (11 risk factors), probably risky (18 risk factors), and unclear (7 risk factors). {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Human reliability is a crucial element in ensuring plant performance during an emergency condition. This is even more true as technology has been evolving exponentially in recent times. In fact, it is evident that technological developments imply a decrease of accidents owing to the use of redundancy and protection. But at the same time, the high technology complexity requires a sophisticated safety management systems and a high level of safety culture. The classical approaches are not sufficient to prevent the occurrence of extraordinary incidents and accidents in which the key element is represented by the 'human factor'. Thus, in this context, it is necessary to face the problem considering the human factor in an holistic way as the causation of several incidents and accidents. The analysis of human factors constitutes a highly interdisciplinary field of study not yet well defined. This paper deals with various aspects of human behaviour that can influence operator reliability. The aim of the research is to propose a novel methodological approach to simulate human errors in emergency condition. The new model is based on an integration of fuzzy cognitive maps techniques and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a multi-criteria technique for organising and analysing complex decisions.

As a novel technology, some aspects of the implementation of VLC have not been deeply considered or tested. Among these aspects, security and its implementation may become an obstacle for VLCs broad usage. In this article, we have used the well-known Risk Matrix methodology to determine the relative risk that several common attacks have in a VLC network. Four examples: a War Driving, a Queensland alike Denial of Service, a Preshared Key Cracking, and an Evil Twin attack, illustrate the utilization of the methodology over a VLC implementation. The used attacks also covered the different areas delimited by the attack taxonomy used in this work. By defining and determining which attacks present a greater risk, the results of this work provide a lead into which areas should be invested to increase the safety of VLC networks. {\textcopyright} 2017 Marin-Garcia et al.

One of the problematic points in application portfolio management is ensuring the information security of the content analyzed. The human factor provides an increase in unauthorized access to important information, its distortion or loss. Timely analysis of the security risk assessment of the respective portfolios of e-commerce offers significantly increases the success of the implementation and implementation of the relevant IT projects and programs. The authors propose the prediction of the results of massive risk trials in e-commerce systems. Such predictions can still made with respect to repeated sampling, based on the classical definition of probability that is provided if the experiment is relatively limited in size. This situation is relatively rare in the IS. Most often, the IS has to deal with a non-repeated sample that investigates units of rare threats. Under such conditions, the distribution of the probability of occurrence of a threat (event) is subject to the hypergeometric law. The analysis clarifies the priority of information security, allowable residual risks and costs of information security measures. Then it concludes on the allowable residual levels of risk and the feasibility of using the specific security options. It has been experimentally confirmed on 10,000 samples out of 10 attacks that in 8507 samples, no more than 8 attacks can be expected, and the greatest load on the security system falls on 2-5 series of attacks. {\textcopyright} 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Particular risk analysis (PRA) is an essential step in the safety assessment process to guarantee the quality of a system in the early phase of system development. Human factors like the physical environment are the most important part of particular risk assessment. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the safety of the system considering human factor and physical factor. In this paper, we propose a new particular risk model (PRM) to improve the modeling ability of the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL). An architecture-based PRA method is presented to support safety assessment for the AADL model of a cyber-physical system. To simulate the PRM with the proposed PRA method, model transformation from PRM to a deterministic and stochastic Petri net model is implemented.

abstract = {Human errors during maintenance operations are one of the most prevalent causes of marine accidents. Seafarers conduct marine system maintenance on-board in a challenging environment, which makes maintenance prone to un-intentional errors. To address this concern, the study of human performance during maintenance operations on ships is necessary as a part of maritime quantitative risk assessment. However, there is a significant lack of appropriate field data and information relating to human performance on-board ships. This study attempts to fill this important data and knowledge gap. It presents a data collection and analysis procedures for maintenance operations of marine systems. Data related to performance-affecting factors is collected from a total of 235 experienced seafarers from Engine Departments (ED) and Deck Departments (DD) through a structured questionnaire. The collected data is then analysed for normality and also for a pairwise significance test. It helps to study the generalization of the data and also to identify the relative importance of the performance-affecting factors. Collected data will help in developing human error assessment techniques for more accurate Human Error Probability (HEP) estimation in marine environmental conditions. Additionally, this study is useful for identifying the relative importance of performance-affecting factors for the maintenance operations of marine systems. Based on the results of this study, workload and stress, and ship motion (roll and pitch) are identified as critical factors affecting seafarers' performance during maintenance operations. These identified high important performance-affecting factors will assist in future human reliability analysis and risk mitigation strategies for improving the safety and reliability of maintenance operations for the marine industry. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {This paper will provide a practical overview, based on the authors' field lifecycle experiences, to the consideration of Human Factors in hazard analyses to support the design and operation of oil and gas installations. In the development of oil and gas projects, human factors issues is informally addressed through the design development but recently the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement's (BSEE) promulgated the rule on Safety Environment Management Systems (SEMS), API RP 75, in 2010, which now formally recognizes human factor during design lifecycle. In particular, for the element of hazard analysis the SEMS regulation states, "human factors should be considered in this analysis". Over the last 10-15 years, there have been industry papers that have discussed this topic at a high level, mostly about integration with Hazards and Operability Studies (HAZOPs). However, Oil & Gas Producers (OGP) Report No. 454, Human Factors Engineering in Projects (2011) provides appropriate guidance within the HAZOP framework to address human factors in hazard analysis. Despite this history and guidance, it is evident that the lessons learned during the application of HFE in design continue to evolve with more engineering design. This paper discussed the OGP report and other guidance on Human Factors in hazard analysis along with practical lessons learned and challenges from the authors' experiences on major offshore design projects on a range of hazard analyses such as HAZOPs, Hazard Identification Studies (HAZIDs), Qualitative Risk Assessments (QRAs) and Escape, Evacuation and Rescue Analyses (EERAs), etc. The challenge continues in integrating more HFE during hazard and risk management activities in all engineering design activities. This paper has provided the impetus, guidance and momentum to address the human element in hazard analysis during the design of oil and gas facilities; this is just "the tip of the spear".

abstract = {The incidence of driving a train through a stop signal continues to have implications for safety on railways. Industry rulebooks advise how to manage these events, but there has been very little investigation of causality from the systems-view. The increasing trend for maximising rail capacities could be exacerbating the issue and warrants investigation from this perspective to determine the factors impinging on safety decisions in train driving. A participative research approach incorporating cab rides, focus groups, and a generative scenario simulation exercise was used to investigate how train movements and safety risk was managed, and the implications of this on the rail organisation. Twenty-eight train drivers participated from eight passenger rail organisations across Australia and New Zealand. Inductive thematic analysis of the data revealed factors associated with (1) changes to signal meaning, (2) the nature of the driver-signal relationship, and (3) the confounding practice of asking a driver if they were "fit to continue" driving after going through a stop signal. The findings reflected a strong pattern of a normalisation of deviance. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomenon and a model outlining prospective solutions for future research is presented to contribute to the development of novel ideas for further thinking and research. {\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Information security is an ever more important risk factor in safety and automation systems. Risk related to such industrial systems are different from that of accidents caused by human errors or by random system failures, as failures are caused by often malicious actions from insiders or outsiders. As opposed to random failures, for cyber security cases, the probability that a certain scenario will take place may be difficult to quantify. The reason for this is that the underlying mechanism driving the risk is not a random process but rather the result of the aggressor's motivations, resources and skills. This paper explains how profiling and categorization based on psychological research and how these are included in the assessment of how likely a particular attack is. The article focuses on external aggressors, but outlines the framework for assessment of insider threats. An adoption of the methodology in a recent case is also described and further research is outlined. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

This quantitative study explores the influence of Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) constructs on security behaviors of undergraduate students. The primary focus of this quantitative study is to answer our primary research question: to what extent do the independent PMT variables (perceived threat severity, perceived threat vulnerability, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and response cost) explain undergraduate students' employment of smartphone security measures? The findings suggest that although all hypotheses were not supported by the analysis; however, self-efficacy and perceived threat vulnerability showed a statistically positive association with several smartphone security measures. However, none of the constructs showed a statistically significant association with using unsecured Wi-Fi in public places. The practical implications of the findings are for industry to focus on better design of smartphone hardware and software (such as antivirus apps) to protect users, and to increase self-efficacy among smartphone undergraduate users through training and education. {\textcopyright} 2021 IEEE.},

This study proposes a bowtie analysis as a conceptual framework for evaluating the safety effect of cooperative intelligent transport systems. These seek to prevent road traffic accidents or mitigate their consequences. Under the assumption of the potential occurrence of a particular single vehicle accident, three case studies demonstrate the application of the bowtie analysis approach in road traffic safety. The approach utilizes exemplary expert estimates and knowledge from literature on the probability of the occurrence of accident risk factors and of the success of safety measures. Fuzzy set theory is applied to handle uncertainty in expert knowledge. Based on this approach, a useful tool is developed to estimate the effects of safety-related cooperative intelligent transport systems in terms of the expected change in accident occurrence and consequence probability. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the driving population. While there is a strong emphasis for older people to maintain their mobility, the safety of older drivers is a serious community concern. Frailty and declines in a range of age-related sensory, cognitive, and physical impairments can place older drivers at an increased risk of crash-related injuries and death. A number of studies have indicated that in-vehicle technologies such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVIS) may provide assistance to older drivers. However, these technologies will only benefit older drivers if their design is congruent with the complex needs and diverse abilities of this driving cohort. The design of ADAS and IVIS is largely informed by automotive Human Machine Interface (HMI) guidelines. However, it is unclear to what extent the declining sensory, cognitive and physical capabilities of older drivers are addressed in the current guidelines. This paper provides a review of key current design guidelines for IVIS and ADAS with respect to the extent they address age-related changes in functional capacities. The review revealed that most of the HMI guidelines do not address design issues related to older driver impairments. In fact, in many guidelines driver age and sensory cognitive and physical impairments are not mentioned at all and where reference is made, it is typically very broad. Prescriptive advice on how to actually design a system so that it addresses the needs and limitations of older drivers is not provided. In order for older drivers to reap the full benefits that in-vehicle technology can afford, it is critical that further work establish how older driver limitations and capabilities can be supported by the system design process, including their inclusion into HMI design guidelines. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Current FRATs are subjective, based on linear analyses and subject-matter expert interpretation of flight factor/risk relationships. However, a ‘flight system' is complex with non-linear relationships between variables and emergent outcomes. A neural network was trained to categorize high and low-risk flight environments from factors such as the weather and pilot experience using data extracted from accident and incident reports. Negative outcomes were used as markers of risk level, with low severity outcomes representing low-risk environments and high severity outcomes representing high-risk environments. Eighteen models with varied architectures were created and evaluated for convergence, generalization and stability. Classification results of the highest performing model indicated that neural networks have the ability to learn and generalize to unseen accident and incident data, suggesting that they have the potential to offer an alternative to current risk analysis methods. {\textcopyright} 2021 Central Institute for Labour Protection - National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).},

This paper provides evaluation results for ADAS using the mutual assistance paradigm, in which drivers mutually assist each other for automobile safety. The goal of the mutual assistance system is not only to reduce the risk of traffic accidents but also to improve the driver's attitude. In this research, evaluation of an assistance system was performed with a driving simulator. The experimental results revealed that the automation level of the mutual assistance system heavily changed the driver's attitude. The semi-automatic system was more effective than the fully automatic system for making positive attitude changes. In addition, the semi-automatic system was the most effective for decreasing the driver collision rate. Therefore, the semi-automatic system with some voluntary actions was most suitable for the mutual assistance system and can possibly restrain risk compensation behavior. {\textcopyright} 2016},

abstract = {This paper addresses human performance risk mitigation strategies for incorporation into a Safety and Environmental Management System (SEMS). A framework is provided that identifies human factors considerations and evaluation criteria needed for successful integration of Human Factors into a company's SEMS. A methodology is presented for assessing safety culture and the effectiveness of SEMS implementation. Results from employee surveys, taken across various high-risk industries, will be presented. The survey findings illustrate the common difficulties encountered in establishing and maintaining a strong safety culture and the challenges in achieving an effective SEMS. Successful integration of Human Factors in SEMS for the Oil and Gas Industry can reduce the risks of accidents and manmade disasters, such as the Macondo Well blowout. Integrating Human Factors into an SEMS might also improve operational efficiency and effectiveness, because Human Factors considers all levels of performance improvement, the individual worker, the work crew (team), and management. Optimum performance by all employees is necessary in order to attain a high level of organizational reliability. These are some components of Human Factors that contribute to improved safety performance and might help to prevent human error accidents and organizational failures: ° Clear specification of personnel qualification standards and required knowledge and skill competencies for both workers and supervisors. ° Utilization of advanced simulation training for individuals and teams. ° Improved collection, analysis, and display of safety critical well test, and other operational data, with better human - interface technology, improved operational procedures, and continuous technical training. ° Identifying critical Human Factors hazards and risk mitigation procedures for inclusion in the overall Safety Environment Management Systems. ° Safety training for line supervisors to include human performance and, communication and risk decision-making limitations and High Reliability Organization - HRO - Culture management principles. ° Routine assessment of Safety Climate and Culture based on HRO principles - to include valid metrics, benchmarking and desired norms. These factors are critical components for an effective SEMS - that if missing, or poorly implemented, can serve as the roots of accidents and manmade disasters like Macondo. They are also key areas of assessment that the author has used across industries to evaluate the strength of safety culture and to judge the effectiveness of a successful integration of Human Factors into a company's SEMS. This methodology and lessons learned from the application of these methods can and should be considered for use in the oil and gas industry for achieving a successful implementation of SEMS.

It presents work have been done to conduct a systematic literature review of papers published on information security culture from 2003 to 2016. The review identified 68 papers that focus on this area, 18 of which propose an information security culture framework. An analysis of these papers indicate there is a positive relationship between levels of knowledge and how employees behave. The level of knowledge significantly affects information security behavior and should be considered as a critical factor in the effectiveness of information security culture and in any further work that is carried out on information security culture. Therefore, there is a need for more studies to identity the security knowledge that needs to be incorporated into organizations and to find instances of best practice for building an information security culture within organizations. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Cold regions have their unique hazards such as hypothermia and frostbite. Hence, these hazards must be taken into account very early in the design phase. Moreover, risk analysis approaches should be updated to take into account the specific hazards of the Cold Climate region. There can be a high dependence between different cold region hazards and a combination of failures can happen during an extreme weather phenomenon. Therefore, the assumptions of independence among the risk factors must be critical examined and the chain of events should be more focused. Sometimes, increasing the reliability will lead to more complex designs. Adding to the complexity of the system, could cause the human error to be increased significantly. Hence, increasing the reliability of a plant or a process by adding complexity, does not necessarily lead to increasing the safety. In this study an analysis of the reliability of a ventilation system in a moderate climate region is used as reference case for a risk analysis of a winterized ventilation system in a Cold region. In the analyses, performance-shaping factors are assessed, stressing the need of a risk analysis in which human and environmental factors are especially examined. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2016 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).},

This review aims to critically examine past HFE research on nuclear safety and provide insights into how HFE approaches can better address current challenges for nuclear safety and future changes (e.g. new technologies, Industry 4.0 and increasing system complexity). The research questions this paper addresses are: (1) what are the common HFE themes and topics that have been applied to nuclear safety? (2) what are the new/key emerging areas/ideas for nuclear safety from an HFE perspective? We reviewed (n = 334) articles from six prominent HFE and safety-focused journals. Articles were classified into a systems framework where research themes and topics could be classified and explored. The findings from the review indicate the primary topics which the nuclear energy industry have focused on have not changed much over time (e.g. safety culture; human error; human-machine interaction) and likewise methods from the 1970s continue to attract attention (e.g. probabilistic risk assessment and human reliability assessment). However, the review demonstrated that more recent topics such as resilience engineering and ideas centred on the ‘Safety-II' and ‘resilience engineering' movement are beginning to appear. One of the main conclusions from the review is that there is a need for greater exploration and experimentation of new and emerging areas of interest and their practical implications within the nuclear energy industry. {\textcopyright} 2020},

abstract = {The opportunity for online engagement increases possible exposure to potentially risky behaviors for teens, which may have significant negative consequences. Effective family communication about online safety can help reduce the risky adolescent behavior and limit the consequences after it occurs. Our paper contributes a theory of communication factors that positively influence teen and parent perception of communication about online safety and provides design implications based on those findings. While previous work identified gaps in family communication regarding online safety, our study quantitatively identified the factors that significantly contribute to parents' and teens' differing perceptions. We analyzed data from a survey of 215 teen-parent pairs through a cross-sectional design and examined the factors that contribute to increased family communication about online safety. For parents, active mediation, technical monitoring, and a perceived positive affect of the teen were associated with higher levels of family communication. Our results were similar for teens, except that the teen's online safety concern and parental monitoring were also positively associated with increased family communication, while restrictive mediation was associated with lower levels of family communication. Many existing designs for online safety support a restrictive approach, despite teens not wanting technical restrictions. A key implication of our findings is that teens view active mediation and monitoring positively in respect to family communication. Contrary to mainstream narratives, this finding suggests that teens value parental involvement and do not desire complete independence online. By examining specific mechanisms which can hinder or improve family communication between parents and teens regarding online safety, we recommend solutions that give teens an active role in their online safety and facilitate effective family communication through cooperation between both parties, rather than technologies that promote parental restriction.},

abstract = {Human reliability assessment (HRA) is an aspect of risk analysis concerned with identifying, analyzing, and quantifying the causes, contributions, and occurrence of human failures. Applications of existing HRA methods are often domain-specific, and difficult to implement even for experts. Also, due to the lack of empirical data, managing uncertainty is important, if not essential. In view of such limitations, we propose a new and comprehensive HRA methodology acronymed “PRELUDE” (Performance shaping factor-based human REliability assessment using vaLUation-baseD systEms). It is a quantitative and qualitative HRA methodology, applied to railway operations. The qualitative part characterizes a safety critical situation using performance shaping factors (PSFs). The PSFs are identified from domain specific human factors and PSF-based studies. The quantitative proposition is a framework of a graphical model (Valuation-based System) and belief functions theory. Appropriate representation and handling of all types of uncertainties, and combination of conflicting expert opinions is considered in this framework. To aid in the choice of appropriate combination method, combined expert data are discussed and compared using quantitative metrics. PRELUDE allows quantifying a human failure event given an operational context. Sensitivity analysis is used to establish a priority ranking among the PSFs. Finally, application on a railway accident scenario describes usage and applicability of our proposition. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Advanced technological systems consist of a combination of hardware and software, and they are often operated or supervised by a human operator. Failures in software-intensive systems may be difficult to identify, analyze, and mitigate, owing to system complexity, system interactions, and cascading effects. Risk analysis of such systems is necessary to ensure safe operation. The traditional approach to risk analysis focuses on hardware failures and, to some extent, on human and organizational factors. Software failures are often overlooked, or it is assumed that the system's software does not fail. Research and industry efforts are directed toward software reliability and safety. However, the effect of software failures on the level of risk of advanced technological systems has so far received little attention. Most analytical methods focus on selected software failures and tend to be inconsistent with respect to the level of analysis. There is a need for risk analysis methods that are able to sufficiently take hardware, software, and human and organizational risk factors into account. Hence, this article presents a foundation that enables software failure to be included in the general framework of risk analysis. This article is the first of two articles addressing the challenges of analyzing software failures and including their potential risk contribution to a system or operation. Hence, the focus is on risks resulting from software failures, and not on software reliability, because risk and reliability are two different aspects of a system. Using a functional perspective on software, this article distinguishes between failure mode, failure cause, and failure effects. Accordingly, 29 failure modes are identified to form a taxonomy and are demonstrated in a case study. The taxonomy assists in identifying software failure modes, which provide input to the risk analysis of software-intensive systems, presented in a subsequent article (Part 2 of 1) (Thieme et al.). {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Avionics is one of the fields in which verification methods have been pioneered and brought about a new level of reliability to systems used in safety-critical environments. Tragedies, like the 2015 insider attack on a German airplane, in which all 150 people on board died, show that safety and security crucially depend not only on the well-functioning of systems but also on the way humans interact with the systems. Policies are a way to describe how humans should behave in their interactions with technical systems. Formal reasoning about such policies requires integrating the human factor into the verification process. In this paper, we report on our work on using logical modelling and analysis of infrastructure models and policies with actors to scrutinize security policies in the presence of insiders. An insider is a user of a system who behaves like an attacker abusing privileges thereby bypassing security controls. We model insider attacks on airplanes in the Isabelle Insider framework. This application motivates the use of an extension of the framework with Kripke structures and the temporal logic CTL to enable reasoning on dynamic system states. Furthermore, we illustrate that Isabelle modelling and invariant reasoning reveal subtle security assumptions. This results in a methodology for the development of policies that satisfy stated properties. To contrast our approach to model checking, we provide an additional comparative analysis. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Traditional risk assessment approaches mainly focus on the pre-failure scenarios with certain information. For complex systems, the scope of risk assessment needs to be extended to include the post-failure phase; because the emerging hazards of these systems cannot be wholly identified and are usually highly uncertain. Thus, resilience assessment needs to be investigated. Most of the existing literature quantify resilience based on a system's performance loss caused by disruptions. These studies fail to assess the probability of a system to sustain or restore to a normal operational state after disruptions occur, how this probability changes with time, and how fast the system can be restored. The dynamic and probabilistic characteristics of resilience must be considered in systemic resilience assessment, in which the engineered system, human and organizational factors, and external disruptions are considered. This paper aims to develop a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)-based approach to the probabilistic assessment of the system resilience by incorporating temporal processes of adaption and recovery into the analysis of system functionality. The proposed method also provides a new way to define resilience in terms of the probability of system functionality change during and after a disruption. A case study on the Chevron refinery accident is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Human operators interacting with complex control systems face safety-critical risks associated with stress and cognitive load, which can compromise human and system performance outcomes. In control rooms, the operator must be constantly vigilant and take appropriate actions while interacting with data management and control systems. These systems primarily rely on sensory cues to alert the operator of required interventions and provide decision support. Human factors design guidance is currently specified for control rooms and digital human-system interfaces (HSIs). However, there is currently a gap empirically linking the human factors control room design guidance to human performance outcomes. This paper will present a human performance modeling and simulation methodology to determine the effectiveness of different control room design specifications through measurement of neurophysiological predictors of cognitive load and human performance outcomes (accuracy, timing, and perceived workload). A simulation environment (Virtual Reality CAVE) is presented as a method to simulate monitoring and decision making tasks. Application of this methodology to empirical data collection will inform HSI best design practices for control rooms to reduce the risks associated with cognitive load, and thus improve operator performance and system safety. {\textcopyright} 2019 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved},

abstract = {Activities involving hazardous substances may cause safety risks to the environment. In addition to hazard reduction measures, such as implementing safety management systems at hazardous facilities, and exposure reduction measures, such as employing safe distances between vulnerable objects and hazardous activities, safety risks can be further minimised through the implementation of vulnerability reduction measures. In the area near where activities involving dangerous substances are being carried out, measures can be taken to reduce the vulnerability, such as increasing the possibilities for emergency response and evacuation. This paper examines what the issues influencing the consideration and implementation of vulnerability reduction measures are. This is done through an examination of land use planning projects in the Netherlands and an analysis of two examinations from the National Human Environment and Transport Inspectorate on the implementation of vulnerability reduction measures to discuss the representativeness of the findings for the Netherlands. The examinations, including the examinations of the Inspectorate, show that the consideration of vulnerability reduction measures is narrower than required by Dutch rules and regulations. Additionally, the implementation of measures is limited. Only half of the vulnerability reduction measures that are adopted in land use plans are actually implemented. Important factors that hampered the consideration and adoption of measures are the restrictions of actual rules and regulation with respect to the enforceability of measures, the limited expertise of those involved and the lack of clarity in tasks and roles regarding the consideration and monitoring of vulnerability reduction measures. More fundamentally, the effectiveness of measures and the need for further risk reduction was discussed. Consequently, more insight is required into the costs and benefits of vulnerability reduction measures and if a more explicit consideration of vulnerability in land use planning practices is desired, elaboration will be needed in the areas of planning legislations, procedures and expertise. & copy; 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

The shift increases the necessity for understanding when to, and to what extent new methods and technology are needed to support the Human Factors Engineering (HFE) process and regulatory review. The NUREG-0711 divides an HFE program into 12 elements grouped within 4 phases of activities where the use of simulators is cited in 6 of the 12 elements. However, these 6 elements describe the use of traditional full scope operator training simulators. Today's real-time simulator has more capability and can have value in all of the 12 elements of the HFE program. The roadmap described here illustrates where today's real-time simulator can integrate best-estimate or safety analysis models; sophisticated HFE analytical tools; modern visualization applications; and configuration management tools to become a real HFE program platform. As an illustration, this paper will discuss a roadmap of obtaining human performance data early in the analysis and design phases and subsequently in the verification & validation (V&V) phase through a collaborative effort of HFE practitioners, simulators and operators. The roadmap described in this paper covers the HFE process, simulator use and operator involvement and provides guidance for when and how to use each of these three important inputs during analysis, design and verification & validation (V&V) phases. The roadmap described here provides a resource for planning and executing a new or revised human machine interface. It supports the traditional waterfall style project framework along with the software agile process and can be used with either revision 2 or 3 of the NUREG-0711. The process illustrated by the roadmap has value to the organization for cost saving and risk reduction when adopting digital safety and control systems, control room modifications and plant modifications affecting risk-informed human actions. This paper illustrates how the early HFE and engineering simulator involvement, t covering the analysis, design and V&V phases, will lead to fewer design changes later.},

abstract = {The financial success of the chemical and petrochemical industry will increasingly depend upon the security of process control systems. This paper presents recommendations and insights gleaned from over 100 security risk assessment (SRA) and process control analyses, using requirements baselines extracted from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publication 800-53 (and Appendix A), the Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, in conjunction with NIST special publication 800-82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems(ICS) Security, to provide the bridge in application of 800-53 controls to IC/SCADA. The paper identifies how current and projected malevolent threats posed by insiders, outsiders, collusion, and system-induced threats can erode system performance in terms of shut downs, sabotage, production disruption, and contamination. The issue is not whether there are clear and present cyber threats, nor whether there are business prudent practices that can be implemented to counter those threats; but rather that there is such a diverse compendium, at times conflicting and often technically obtuse guidance, that clarity is needed to narrow the focus of this guidance to assist those responsible for implementing effective process control security. The paper focuses on application of business-prudent controls and discusses how disparities in implementation of controls can exacerbate system vulnerabilities. Topics include issues of processes control system management, systems documentation, use of contractors and remote contractor access, system authorities that exceed user needs, misalignment of staff perception of information asset values, exposures related to use of USB ports, lack of encryption, and background surety gaps for individuals and contractor companies with access to process control systems. The paper examines the dynamics of communicating information from process control systems to business IT systems and the pressure from business operations to capture process data and make it available in near real-time through administrative networks. Such pressures may influence systems administrators to overlook or ignore firewall and systems engineering architecture, increasing potentials for two-way interface between business and process control that significantly increases exploit exposures. Despite the availability of excellent guidelines for physical and technical security of IT related assets, these practices are too often unheeded in favor of expediency or expanded access. The paper includes a discussion of Risk Management Framework models that should be considered to enhance the correspondences and relationships between multiple organizational domains, thereby promoting more effective cyber security for current and future process control systems. The paper summarizes the process for establishing security for industrial control systems (ICS), and addresses cyber security baseline requirements and expectations, within a risk management framework that provides a decision basis, threat dynamics, common vulnerabilities, and prudent mitigation measures. Much of this summary has been derived from The Information Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and NIST SP 800-82, Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security. NIST has also published Applying NIST SP 800-53 to Industrial Control Systems which demonstrates the relationship of 800-53 to ICS security and the application of more than 20 control families and over 625 control elements to ICS security. Although originally designed for Federal systems, portions of these publications also provide a solid foundation for critical commercial and industrial information control systems in terms of addressing the basic questions that companies in the process industry should consider when selecting security controls, including: • What controls are actually needed to protect process systems, while supporting operations and safeguarding critical assets? • Can the selected controls suggested for Federal systems effectively be implemented for systems in the process industry? • Once selected and implemented, will these controls really be effective in protecting the processes? NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems, helps answer questions to strengthen commercial processes information security programs. The security controls articulated in NIST SP 800-53 provide guidance and recommend practices applicable to security systems in process industries, to provide a foundation for understanding the fundamental concepts of security controls. The introductory material presents the concept of security controls and their use within well-defined information security programs. Some of the issues discussed include the structural components of controls, how the controls are organized into families, and the use of controls to support information security programs. The guide outlines the essential steps that should be followed to determine needed controls, to assure the effectiveness of controls, and to maintain the effectiveness of installed controls. The appendices in NIST SP 800-53 provide additional resources including general references, definitions, explanation of acronyms, a breakdown of security controls for graduated levels of security requirements, a catalog of security controls, and information relating security controls to other standards and control sets. The controls are organized into classes of operational, management, and technical controls, and then into families within each class. To maintain parity and applicability with advances in technology, NIST also plans to review and to update the controls in the catalog as technology changes and new safeguards and new information security countermeasures are identified.

abstract = {In the light of the expanding digitization, connectivity and interconnection of machines, products, and services in Industrie 4.0, the increasing trend of digitalization and transformation to cyber-physical production systems reveal serious cybersecurity-related issues. BSI (the federal office for information security) in Germany has compiled a list of the most cybersecurity threats faced by manufacturing and process automation systems. The results show that the top threats are social engineering and phishing. From these two threats, it is clear that use of non-technical means like human weaknesses and/or unawareness is gaining a lot of prominence. The aim is to gain unauthorized access to target information and IT systems. Furthermore, the goal is to install malware in the victim's systems, for example, by opening infected attachments. Therefore, human factor becomes a widely discussed topic by cybersecurity incidents nowadays. Facing these threats by utilizing technical measurements alone is not sufficient. Thus, it is important to provide engineers with an adequate cybersecurity awareness like, new possible threats and risks caused by extensive using of digitization. To fill this gap of knowledge at engineering faculties, this paper presents an effective course that concentrates on cybersecurity issues. The focus is to improve the ability to understand and detect these new cybersecurity threats in the industry. By designing this innovative and effective course, a new assessment model is developed. The model is based on important aspects that are required for enhancing student's social competences and skills. In the first step, students should work together in teams on a given problem based on best practice examples and contents learned during the course. Another aspect that the mentioned assessment model focuses on is giving a feedback review. In this phase, students have to read the paper of another group and then give a systematic feedback according to specific identified criteria. In the final step, students have to present the results and discuss them with the advisor and then get their grades. Our findings show that there is an acute lack of social competence and skill enhancement by the engineering faculties. We believe that these skills are fundamental for engineering careers and therefore are intensively considered in the introduced course and assessment model. {\textcopyright} 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {Research on the Internet of Things (IoT) has devoted many efforts to technological aspects. Little social and practical benefits have emerged so far. IoT devices, so-called smart objects, are becoming even more pervasive and social, leading to the need to provide non-technical users with innovative interaction strategies for controlling their behavior. In other words, the opportunities offered by IoT can be amplified if new approaches are conceived to enable non-technical users to be directly involved in "composing" their smart objects by synchronizing their behavior. To fulfill this goal, this article introduces a model that includes new operators for defining rules combining multiple events and conditions exposed by smart objects, and for defining temporal and spatial constraints on rule activation. The article also presents the results of an elicitation study that was conducted to identify possible visual paradigms for expressing composition rules. Prototypes implementing the resulting visual paradigms were compared during a controlled experiment and the one that resulted most relevant for our goals was used in a study that involved home-automation experts. Finally, the article discusses some design implications that came out from the performed studies and presents the architecture of a platform supporting rule definition and execution.},

abstract = {Applying systems theory to information security enables security analysts to consider the socio-technical role of the security system instead of only focusing on the technical part. Systems theory can also equip security analysts with the skills required to have a holistic and an abstract level of understanding of the security problem in their organisations and to proactively define and evaluate existing risks. The Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) developed by Peter Checkland was created in order to deal with unstructured situations where human beings are part of the socio-technical system. In this paper, SSM is applied as a framework to diagnose a real case security incident in an organisation. The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how the methodology can be considered a beneficial tool for security analysts during security incident management and risk analysis. Literature review and experience indicate an existing lack of customisable incident response tools that facilitate communication and elaboration within organizations during incident management. In addition to the fact that these tools are mainly technical and don't take the human factor into consideration. Using SSM as such, we define the security attack as a human activity transformation system that transforms a security event triggered by an attacker into a security breach that cause damage to the victim organisation. The attack system is then modelled to include a number of dependent activity sub-systems that interact with each other and their environment including the security control activity systems. By having such systemic perception of a security attack, security analysts, we suggest, can have a holistic perception under what conditions a security attack has succeeded and what elements of the socio-technical system and its environment should have been considered in order to mitigate and reduce the risk exposure.},

abstract = {Accurately modeling human decision-making in security is critical to thinking about when, why, and how to recommend that users adopt certain secure behaviors. In this work, we conduct behavioral economics experiments to model the rationality of end-user security decision-making in a realistic online experimental system simulating a bank account. We ask participants to make a financially impactful security choice, in the face of transparent risks of account compromise and benefits offered by an optional security behavior (two-factor authentication). We measure the cost and utility of adopting the security behavior via measurements of time spent executing the behavior and estimates of the participant's wage. We find that more than 50% of our participants made rational (e.g., utility optimal) decisions, and we find that participants are more likely to behave rationally in the face of higher risk. Additionally, we find that users' decisions can be modeled well as a function of past behavior (anchoring effects), knowledge of costs, and to a lesser extent, users' awareness of risks and context (R2=0.61). We also find evidence of endowment effects, as seen in other areas of economic and psychological decision-science literature, in our digital-security setting. Finally, using our data, we show theoretically that a “one-size-fits-all” emphasis on security can lead to market losses, but that adoption by a subset of users with higher risks or lower costs can lead to market gains.},

abstract = {Human factors play an important role in the safe operation of a facility. Human factors include the systematic application of information about human characteristics and behavior to increase the safety of a process system. A significant proportion of human errors occur during the maintenance phase. However, the quantification of human error probabilities in the maintenance phase has not been given the amount of attention it deserves. This paper focuses on a human factors analysis in pre-and post- pump maintenance operations. The procedures for removing process equipment from service (pre-maintenance) and returning the equipment to service (post-maintenance) are considered for possible failure scenarios. For each scenario, human error probability is calculated for each activity using the Success Likelihood Index Method (SLIM). Consequences are also assessed in this methodology. The risk assessment is conducted for each component and the overall risk is estimated by adding individual risks. The present study is aimed at highlighting the importance of considering human error in quantitative risk analyses. The developed methodology has been applied to a case study of an offshore process facility. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Human factor plays an inevitable role in maintenance activities and the occurrence of human errors impacts on system reliability and safety, equipment performance and economic results. Many factors, such as work environment, organization, individual features, influence the performance of maintenance technicians with a consequent variability in the success of interventions. This paper presents a literature review concerning Human Error in Maintenance (HEM) with the aim of investigating, through a critical analysis, the current HEM state-of-The-Art in industrial systems and highlighting the research and practice gaps. A systematic review was conducted using two databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and a set of specific keywords in order to identify and select peer-reviewed papers that presented evidence on the relationship between human performance and maintenance activities. A total of 63 studies were selected and then analysed through a pre-determined systematic methodology. This has allowed to classify and critically assess the selected papers as function of: Types and typical human errors in maintenance; error contributing factors; maintenance policies; methodologies for human error analysis; maintenance error consequences; industrial sectors. The analysis outlines the relevance of considering HEM because different error types occur during the maintenance process with non-negligible effects on the system. High-risk sectors, like nuclear power plant or aviation, have strongly taken into account human error in maintenance activities, whereas in manufacturing systems HEM has not received the amount of attention that it deserves. This paper motivates future developments for HEM assessment and management particularly in manufacturing sector, due to the evidenced gap in literature, providing several research opportunities.},

To tackle this problem, we present AppMoD, a community-based approach that allows delegation of security and privacy decisions a trusted social connection, such as a family member or a close friend. The trusted social connection can assist in the appropriate decision or make it on behalf of the user. We implement the approach as an Android app and describe the results of three user studies (n=50 altogether), in which pairs of older adults and family members used the app in a controlled experiment. Using app anomalies as an ongoing case study, we show how delegation improves the accuracy of decisions made by older adults. Also, we show how combining decision-delegation with crowdsourcing can enhance the advice given and improve the decision-making process.

abstract = {Research on autonomous ships has led to several ideas about how they could be operated in terms of level of automation and human presence. However, all seem to point towards systems that will be more complex due to issues such as the tighter integration with software and the interactions with humans-in-the-loop. These ships will likely be completely different compared to conventional ones, which puts into question the usefulness of our current understanding of risk and how it is managed for ensuring safe operation. By a critical review of the literature, this paper highlights the need for advanced methods that will combine machine learning and simulation for dynamically assessing risk in a life cycle context and effectively transferring acquired operational knowledge back to the design phase. The main objective of this paper is to describe a novel life cycle risk framework for developing algorithms inspired by the biological immune system, which provides lifetime protection from harmful pathogens. This framework can be used to construct machine learning algorithms for dynamic risk monitoring and adaptive risk control that address different types of risk, while enabling faster future response to previously unencountered risks and operational feedback to design through learning. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in a specific maritime context with a case study on collision risk identification. Considering the lack of experience for autonomous ships, the benefit of our immune-inspired approach is that it departs from the classic risk scenario concept and that it does not rely on safety performance data for identifying risk factors and training the algorithms. We suggest this framework is particularly suitable for autonomous ships with high levels of autonomy, although applicable to conventional ships as well, as it can contribute to empowering them with risk awareness and the capability to deal with any risk environment. {\textcopyright} IMechE 2022.},

abstract = {“Human error” is often implicated as a causal factor in accident investigation yet very little is done to understand ‘why' such errors occur in the first place. This paper uses the principles of Schema Theory and the Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM) to further explore the circumstances surrounding the fatal Tesla crash in May 2016 in which the driver was fatally injured using team-PCM representations. The preliminary National Highway Traffic Safety Administration accident investigation concluded that the driver of the Tesla Model S was at fault. However, the analysis presented in this paper argues that rather than “driver error”, the underlying cause of this tragic incident could be in fact more akin to a “designer error” implicating the design of the Autopilot feature itself. This is in line with the National Transportation Safety Boards more recent announcement that suggests systems design may have contributed to the crash. It would therefore appear that the drivers expectation of system functionality may not have matched the real life capabilities of the system. This is likely to be a product of inappropriate mental models relating to system function. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Understanding the inner workings of such malware provides a leverage to effectively combat them. This understanding is pursued often through dynamic analysis which is conducted manually or automatically. Malware authors accordingly, have devised and advanced evasion techniques to thwart or evade these analyses. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on malware dynamic analysis evasion techniques. In addition, we propose a detailed classification of these techniques and further demonstrate how their efficacy holds against different types of detection and analysis approaches. Our observations attest that evasive behavior is mostly concerned with detecting and evading sandboxes. The primary tactic of such malware we argue is fingerprinting followed by new trends for reverse Turing test tactic which aims at detecting human interaction. Furthermore, we will posit that the current defensive strategies, beginning with reactive methods to endeavors for more transparent analysis systems, are readily foiled by zero-day fingerprinting techniques or other evasion tactics such as stalling. Accordingly, we would recommend the pursuit of more generic defensive strategies with an emphasis on path exploration techniques that has the potential to thwart all the evasive tactics.},

abstract = {Ninety-four common genetic variants are confirmed to be associated with breast cancer. This study tested the hypothesis that breast cancer susceptibility variants may also be associated with chemotherapy-induced toxicity through shared mechanistic pathways such as DNA damage response, an association that, to our knowledge, has not been previously investigated. The study included breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy from the Pharmacogenetic SNPs (PGSNPS) study. For each patient, a breast cancer polygenic risk score was created from the 94 breast cancer risk variants, all of which were genotyped or successfully imputed in PGSNPS. Logistic regression was performed to test the association with two clinically important toxicities: taxane- related neuropathy (n = 1279) and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (n = 1676). This study was well powered (≥96%) to detect associations between polygenic risk score and chemotherapy toxicity. Patients with high breast cancer risk scores experienced less neutropenia compared to those with low risk scores (adjusted p-value = 0.06). Exploratory functional pathway analysis was performed and no functional pathways driving this trend were identified. Polygenic risk was not associated with taxane neuropathy (adjusted p-value = 0.48). These results suggest that breast cancer patients with high genetic risk of breast cancer, conferred by common variants, can safely receive standard chemotherapy without increased risk of taxane-related sensory neuropathy or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and may experience less neutropenia. As neutropenia has previously been associated with improved survival and may reflect drug efficacy, these patients may be less likely to benefit from standard chemotherapy treatment. {\textcopyright} 2016 Dorling et al.

abstract = {Malicious insiders cause significant loss to organizations. Due to an extremely small number of malicious activities from insiders, insider threat is hard to detect. In this article, we present a Dirichlet Marked Hawkes Process (DMHP) to detect malicious activities from insiders in real-time. DMHP combines the Dirichlet process and marked Hawkes processes to model the sequence of user activities. The Dirichlet process is capable of detecting unbounded user modes (patterns) of infinite user activities, while, for each detected user mode, one set of marked Hawkes processes is adopted to model user activities from time and activity type (e.g., WWW visit or send email) information so that different user modes are modeled by different sets of marked Hawkes processes. To achieve real-time malicious insider activity detection, the likelihood of the most recent activity calculated by DMHP is adopted as a score to measure the maliciousness of the activity. Since the majority of user activities are benign, those activities with low likelihoods are labeled as malicious activities. Experimental results on two datasets show the effectiveness of DMHP.},

abstract = {The rapid digitalisation of the hospitality industry over recent years has brought forth many new points of attack for consideration. The hasty implementation of these systems has created a reality in which businesses are using the technical solutions, but employees have very little awareness when it comes to the threats and implications that they might present. This gap in awareness is further compounded by the existence of pre-established, often rigid, cultures that drive how hospitality businesses operate. Potential attackers are recognising this and the last two years have seen a huge increase in cyber-attacks within the sector. Attempts at addressing the increasing threats have taken the form of technical solutions such as encryption, access control, CCTV, etc. However, a high majority of security breaches can be directly attributed to human error. It is therefore necessary that measures for addressing the rising trend of cyber-attacks go beyond just providing technical solutions and make provision for educating employees about how to address the human elements of security. Inculcating security awareness amongst hospitality employees will provide a foundation upon which a culture of security can be created to promote the seamless and secured interaction of hotel users and technology. One way that the hospitality industry has tried to solve the awareness issue is through their current paper-based training. This is unengaging, expensive and presents limited ways to deploy, monitor and evaluate the impact and effectiveness of the content. This leads to cycles of constant training, making it very hard to initiate awareness, particularly within those on minimum waged, short-term job roles.This paper presents a structured approach for eliciting industry requirement for developing and implementing an immersive Cyber Security Awareness learning platform. It used a series of over 40 interviews and threat analysis of the hospitality industry to identify the requirements for designing and implementing cyber security program which encourage engagement through a cycle of reward and recognition. In particular, the need for the use of gamification elements to provide an engaging but gentle way of educating those with little or no desire to learn was identified and implemented. Also presented is a method for guiding and monitoring the impact of their employee's progress through the learning management system whilst monitoring the levels of engagement and positive impact the training is having on the business. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

For many devices, it is critical to identify the wearer, allowing sensor data to be properly labeled or personalized behavior to be properly achieved. In this paper we propose the use of vocal resonance, that is, the sound of the person's voice as it travels through the person's body -- a method we anticipate would be suitable for devices worn on the head, neck, or chest. In this regard, we go well beyond the simple challenge of speaker recognition: we want to know who is wearing the device. We explore two machine-learning approaches that analyze voice samples from a small throat-mounted microphone and allow the device to determine whether (a) the speaker is indeed the expected person, and (b) the microphone-enabled device is physically on the speaker's body. We collected data from 29 subjects, demonstrate the feasibility of a prototype, and show that our DNN method achieved balanced accuracy 0.914 for identification and 0.961 for verification by using an LSTM-based deep-learning model, while our efficient GMM method achieved balanced accuracy 0.875 for identification and 0.942 for verification.},

abstract = {International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [1] Nuclear Security Recommendations on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Nuclear Facilities guidance to sovereign states clearly establishes that the disciplines of nuclear safety and nuclear security are of equal importance. Both activities have an ultimate common purpose of protecting the public from harm. Both must be delivered in a coherent, mutually supporting manner. Both disciplines create obligations in order to protect society, the public and employees from hazards arising from nuclear material and activities. Yet most nuclear site licensees currently have different arrangements for nuclear safety and nuclear security. Indeed, there is a commonly held belief in the civil nuclear industry that nuclear security is merely a subset of nuclear safety. Many believe, incorrectly, that delivering effective nuclear safety will, de-facto, also result in effective nuclear security. That assumption is fundamentally incorrect. However, nuclear safety outcomes: fail safe; graceful degradation; prevention of unacceptable radiological consequences are not entirely coincident with, nor are they a sub-set of, nuclear security outcomes. Although they have similar principles, there are also distinct differences. Through operating experience, safety hazards can be quantifiable through equipment failure rates, human error rates, and process risks. These can be analysed and scored to assist licensees to demonstrate that safety hazards are being reduced to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) [2]. Whereas security risks are much more qualitative, driven by both rational and irrational factors in the form of a potentially intelligent adversary. Consequently there is an extreme level of unpredictability, requiring imprecise but proportionate judgements. This requires a fundamental 'culture shift' at every level of organisation, and a corresponding investment in resources and capabilities to enable the assessment, management and assurance of security risks and resilience. Shifts in published and emerging guidance will illustrate developments and expectations with nuclear specific and generic guidance including: • CPNI Securing Industrial Control Systems • NIST SP 800-82 Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security R2 • NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF) • IAEA Nuclear Security Series Computer security of instrumentation and control systems at nuclear facilities • IAEA NST022 and NST036 • IEC 62859 Ed. 1.0 • IEC 62645 Ed. 2.0 The authors offer some guiding key principles - relevant good practice - that should form the basis of implementing effective cyber security by nuclear licensees. These principles, which reflect international standards development, will be explored in more detail in a follow-on paper by the same authors. Nuclear Industries Security Regulations (NISR) 2003 [3] create obligations on duty holders that are additional to nuclear and conventional safety obligations that are contained within the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 [4], the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974 [5], associated regulations, and nuclear Licence Conditions. Other industry sectors have similar challenges and developments to address similar issues will illustrate the necessity and applicable good practice. It is an expectation that, in due course, there will be a move to one overall set of objectives for both nuclear safety and nuclear security. This reflects the convergence and balance required. {\textcopyright} 2016, Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Alongside the development and testing of new audible alarms intended to support International Electrotechnical Commission 60601-1-8, a global standard concerned with alarm safety, the categories of risk that the standard denotes require further thought and possible updating. In this article, we revisit the origins of the categories covered by the standard. These categories were based on the ways that tissue damage can be caused. We consider these categories from the varied professional perspectives of the authors: human factors, semiotics, clinical practice, and the patient or family (layperson). We conclude that while the categories possess many clinically applicable and defensible features from our range of perspectives, the advances in alarm design now available may allow a more flexible approach. We present a three-tier system with superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels that fit both within the thinking embodied in the current standard and possible new developments. Work is underway to update the audible alarms associated with an important global medical device standard, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60601-1-8, General requirements, tests and guidance for alarm systems in medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems.1 The standard, which is concerned with the safety of medical devices, specifies the audible alarms that should accompany the risk categories described. The audible alarms themselves were demonstrated to be less than optimal.2-5 Four sets of prototype updates were developed and are in the process of being benchmarked.6 The alarms then will be made available for further testing. An important issue emerging from this work is that the categories of risk specified in the standard may require updating in addition to the audible alarms. In this article, we revisit the categories from our multidisciplinary perspective in an attempt to open up a discussion of the categories and suggest how updating them might be approached. The writing team consisted of a human factors and auditory alarms specialist, a semiotician, two anesthesiologists, and a layperson who might be a patient or a member of a patient's family. This article is not a systematic or a narrative review. It is a collection of viewpoints aimed at stimulating debate.

It is a part of the IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) protocol stack. Features such as energy-efficient mechanisms and availability of the secure modes of operations make RPL suitable for the constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hence, the majority of IoT applications rely on RPL for data communication. However, routing security in RPL-based IoT networks is a significant concern, motivating us to study and analyze routing attacks and suggested countermeasures against them. To this end, we provide a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art security threats and their corresponding countermeasures in RPL-based IoT networks. Based on our study, we propose a novel classification scheme that uses a mapping between RPL attacks and their countermeasure techniques to the RPL control messages used to develop these techniques. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth statistical analysis that includes analysis of routing attacks through the RPL control messages, distribution of various mitigation techniques as per the method used, RPL control messages involved in the mitigation techniques, and details of the tools used by multiple researchers. In the end, we highlight some open challenges and future research opportunities on this topic. We believe that this survey will be beneficial to researchers and practitioners working in the area of RPL security.},

abstract = {This paper discusses state of the art of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), drones (unmanned aerial vehicle -UAV's) and control infrastructure. The focus has been to explore risks, vulnerabilities and safe use of UAS in industrial operations. The use of UAS has been in rapid expansion in governmental areas (monitoring, military applications) and in the public domain (leisure, photography, transportation, monitoring). Several vulnerabilities have been identified. Few empirical analyses of operations, incidents and successful recoveries are available due to limited reporting. However, safety information from military drone operations are available. The three research questions in this paper are to describe planned use of UAS, major risks and benefits of UAS, and needed research, requirements and rules to improve safety and resilience of operations. We have explored the status of research in Norway, we have performed a literature review of autonomy in aviation, and we have explored relevant cases of industrial transport systems. Our findings indicate that rules and regulations are lagging development of technology and that there is poor focus on major risks related to human factors in engineering, design and operations. To ensure that safety and resilience is in focus from design, there is a need to define scope (i.e. control system as part of UAS) establish functional guidelines (such as human factors guidelines) and improve regulatory frameworks. {\textcopyright} 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

abstract = {The goal of privacy metrics is tomeasure the degree of privacy enjoyed by users in a system and the amount of protection offered by privacy-enhancing technologies. In this way, privacy metrics contribute to improving user privacy in the digital world. The diversity and complexity of privacy metrics in the literature make an informed choice of metrics challenging. As a result, instead of using existing metrics, new metrics are proposed frequently, and privacy studies are often incomparable. In this survey, we alleviate these problems by structuring the landscape of privacy metrics. To this end, we explain and discuss a selection of over 80 privacy metrics and introduce categorizations based on the aspect of privacy they measure, their required inputs, and the type of data that needs protection. In addition, we present a method on how to choose privacy metrics based on nine questions that help identify the right privacy metrics for a given scenario, and highlight topics where additional work on privacy metrics is needed. Our survey spans multiple privacy domains and can be understood as a general framework for privacy measurement.},

abstract = {Much of political debate focuses on the concern that machines might take over. Yet in many domains it is much more plausible that the ultimate choice and responsibility remain with a human decision-maker, but that she is provided with machine advice. A quintessential illustration is the decision of a judge to bail or jail a defendant. In multiple jurisdictions in the US, judges have access to a machine prediction about a defendant's recidivism risk. In our study, we explore how receiving machine advice influences people's bail decisions. We run a vignette experiment with laypersons whom we test on a subsample of cases from the database of this prediction tool. In study 1, we ask them to predict whether defendants will recidivate before tried, and manipulate whether they have access to machine advice. We find that receiving machine advice has a small effect, which is biased in the direction of predicting no recidivism. In the field, human decision makers sometimes have a chance, after the fact, to learn whether the machine has given good advice. In study 2, after each trial we inform participants of ground truth. This does not make it more likely that they follow the advice, despite the fact that the machine is (on average) slightly more accurate than real judges. This also holds if initially the advice is mostly correct, or if it initially is mostly to predict (no) recidivism. Real judges know that their decisions affect defendants' lives. They may also be concerned about reelection or promotion. Hence a lot is at stake. In study 3 we emulate high stakes by giving participants a financial incentive. An incentive to find the ground truth, or to avoid false positive or false negatives, does not make participants more sensitive to machine advice. But an incentive to follow the advice is effective.

abstract = {One reason that young novice drivers remain statistically over-represented in road deaths is their rate of engagement in risky driving. Prominent contributing factors include driver's age, sex, personality, risk perception, and their driving experience. This study applied reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST, specifically reward sensitivity and punishment sensitivity) to predict young novice drivers' perceived risk and self-reported risky driving engagement, while accounting for potential influences of age, sex, and driving experience. Drivers (N = 643, 490 females, 17–25 years, M = 20.02, SD = 2.32) who held an Australian driver's license (P1, P2, or Open) anonymously completed an online survey containing the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale, the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, and a measure of perceived risk of driving-related behaviours. A path analytic model derived from RST showed that perceived risk had the strongest negative association with reported risky driving engagement, followed by reward sensitivity (positive association). Respondent's age and reward sensitivity were associated with perceived risk. Age, reward sensitivity, and perceived risk were associated with reported engagement in risky driving behaviours. Driver sex only had direct paths with RST variables, and through reward sensitivity, indirect paths to perceived risk, and reported risky driving. Neither punishment sensitivity nor driving experience contributed significantly to the model. Implications and applications of the model, and the unique set of variables examined, are discussed in relation to road safety interventions and driver training. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to highlight the relation of psychosocial risks to information security (IS). Although psychosocial risks at the workplace have been extensively researched from a managerial point of view, their effect on IS has not been formally studied to the extent required by the gravity of the topic. Design/methodology/approach - Based on existing research on psychosocial risks, their potential effects on IS are examined. Findings - It is shown that as psychosocial risks affect people at the workplace, they diminish their ability to defend IS. Research limitations/implications - Psychosocial risks are identified as a factor in IS breakdown. Future research should be directed towards assessing the significance of the effects of various psychosocial risks on IS, creating an assessment methodology for the resulting IS posture of the organisation and devising mitigation methodologies. Practical implications - The proposed approach will provide a significant part of the answer to the question of why IS fails when all prescribed measures and controls are in place and active. More effective controls for psychosocial risks at the workplace can be created as the incentive of upholding IS will be added to the equation of their mitigation. Social implications - The organisational environment in which human beings are called upon to function in a secure manner will be redefined, along with what constitutes a 'reasonable request' from human operators in the context of IS. Originality/value - Bringing together psychosocial risks and IS in research will provide a better understanding of the shortcomings of human nature with respect to IS. Organisations and employees will benefit from the resulting psychosocial risk mitigation. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Minor safety incidents on the railway cause disruption, and may be indicators of more serious safety risks. The following paper aimed to gain an understanding of the relationship between active and latent factors, and particular causal paths for these types of incidents by using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) to examine rail industry incident reports investigating such events. 78 reports across 5 types of incident were reviewed by two authors and cross-referenced for interrater reliability using the index of concordance. The results indicate that the reports were strongly focused on active failures, particularly those associated with work-related distraction and environmental factors. Few latent factors were presented in the reports. Different causal pathways emerged for memory failures for events such a failure to call at stations, and attentional failures which were more often associated with signals passed at danger. The study highlights a need for the rail industry to look more closely at latent factors at the supervisory and organisational levels when investigating minor safety of the line incidents. The results also strongly suggest the importance of a new factor – operational environment – that captures unexpected and non-routine operating conditions which have a risk of distracting the driver. Finally, the study provides further demonstration of the utility of HFACS to the rail industry, and of the usefulness of the index of concordance measure of interrater reliability. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Human reliability analysis (HRA) plays an important role in probabilistic safety assessment because human error probability (HEP) strongly influences not only core damage frequency in the nuclear field, for example, but also risk insight across many industries. Conventional HRA methods though use thermal-hydraulic analysis with best-estimate or conservative conditions to estimate the available time for a given operator action, thus significantly overestimating HEP. In response, this paper suggests a new method to more precisely quantify HEP using realistic thermal-hydraulic analyses with exhaustive conditions. The developed method was applied to the rapid cooldown operation in a small loss-of-coolant accident in the APR1400 nuclear power plant. As a result, it was found that conventional HRA methods currently overestimate the risk-significance of this rapid cooldown operation by a factor of six. It is expected that the new HRA method can be applied to not only the nuclear field but also other complex systems to accurately estimate system failure probabilities for specific scenarios by means of more realistic HEP. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Over the last few years, there has been an almost exponential increase in the number of mobile applications that deal with sensitive data, such as applications for e-commerce or health. When dealing with sensitive data, classical authentication solutions based on username-password pairs are not enough, and multi-factor authentication solutions that combine two or more authentication factors of different categories are required instead. Even if several solutions are currently used, their security analyses have been performed informally or semiformally at best, and without a reference model and a precise definition of the multi-factor authentication property. This makes a comparison among the different solutions both complex and potentially misleading. In this article, we first present the design of two reference models for native applications based on the requirements of two real-world use-case scenarios. Common features between them are the use of one-time password approaches and the support of a single sign-on experience. Then, we provide a formal specification of our threat model and the security goals, and discuss the automated security analysis that we performed. Our formal analysis validates the security goals of the two reference models we propose and provides an important building block for the formal analysis of different multi-factor authentication solutions.},

abstract = {Increasingly evident safety risks due to attacks on safety-critical devices are causing new requirements for authentication of these devices' human operators. These requirements have now extended to medical devices. However, authentication may also introduce new safety risks, reduce usability, cause delays, and/or encourage user behaviors that compromise the very security it should protect. Thus, design of authentication mechanisms needs to take on a holistic approach that considers such interrelationships, and the effects not just of the general method chosen (say, passwords vs. fingerprints), but also of its implementation details. We illustrate this problem on a medical case study. We report early steps in a trade-off analysis that captures interactions between safety, security, usability and performance issues, to assist designers in choosing and tuning viable solutions. A qualitative analysis to narrow down the field of possible solutions is followed by a probabilistic analysis. The analyses highlight non-obvious links between system attributes, especially links due to the complex way humans interact with, and adapt to, such devices. The probabilistic analysis systematically describes risk as a function of the authentication method and its design parameters. We show example results quantifying how some key design parameters produce opposite effects on risk due to accidental and malicious causes, requiring a trade-off: the quantitative model allows the designer to manage this trade-off to achieve an acceptable level of overall risk, taking into account environmental factors like the expected prevalence of certain attack types. Both the qualitative and quantitative approaches aim to help device designers make rational decisions about authentication options and the tuning of their design parameters.  {\textcopyright} 2022 Owner/Author.},

We found that children recognized certain privacy and security components from the contextual integrity framework, but children ages 5-7 had gaps in their knowledge. Children developed some strategies to manage concerns but largely relied on parents for support. Parents primarily used passive strategies to mediate children's device use and largely deferred teaching children about these concerns to the future. We argue that helping children develop strong privacy and security practices at a young age will prepare them to manage their privacy and security as adolescents and adults.

abstract = {Factor hierarchies have been widely used in the literature to represent the view of an expert of what factors most contribute to reliability or safety. The methods for rating and aggregating the influences across a set of expert-elicited factors to risk or reliability are well known as multiple criteria decision analysis. This paper describes a method for distinguishing levels of risk across a set of locations via the use of multiple factor hierarchies. The method avoids averaging across experts and is thus useful for situations where experts disagree and where an absence of expert consensus on the causative or contributing factors is important information for risk management. A case study demonstrates using seven expert perspectives on the airport-specific factors that can contribute to runway incursions. The results are described for eighty towered airports in the US. The expert perspectives include differing relative emphases across the following set of factors: airport geometry, operations, weather, geography, and days since last safety review. Future work is suggested to include human factors issues as pilot-and-controller communications styles at airports. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Organisations are required to manage industrial safety by implementing risk treatments to prevent hazardous events. In the absence of objective failure data, risk estimates are generated in facilitated workshops that rely on the judgement of diverse technical opinion from subject matter experts. These estimates generate the performance targets for the engineering controls referred to in the Hierarchy of Controls embedded in work health and safety regulations. This novel study investigated biases within the context of facilitating risk assessment workshops which can lead to understatement of risk estimates. Such biases can be dangerous and potentially difficult to prevent or mitigate. Interviews with facilitators and technical experts (N = 23) were conducted, with experience covering eight substantive industry sectors including oil/gas, mining, and chemical processing. Conventional content analysis identified five biases at a group level and one at an individual level and ranged from cultural or societal forces, industry norms, company pressures, as well as pressures associated with occupational roles, and highly dominant individual views. These were mapped across Rasmussen's (1997) socio-technical systems model to identify potential mitigative/preventive measures that might improve risk assessments from levels higher in the system. Practical implications and future research directions are drawn. {\textcopyright} 2022 The Author(s)},

Currently, the production and transport facilities of the complex are distinguished by the degree of impact on the country's security, economy and ecology: objects of technical regulation, hazardous production facilities, critical facilities, strategic facilities. It is clear that various classes of systems should be used for these objects health monitoring. Principles of monitoring construction documented in the literature are reflected in the standards. Monitoring systems should provide information on the equipment (monitoring object) status in the required quantity and quality to provide observability of its technical state. Observation systems results should advance to take control actions, which provide the required stability margin processing facility, quality of its operation, create a necessary supply of technological, environmental and economic safety. These systems form the basis of automated control systems for the safe resource-saving operation of equipment in real time within the whole enterprise. Risk decisions are determined by monitoring errors - static, dynamic, and those due to the influence of human factor. A significant effect of a static error detection on the magnitude of a dynamic error detection and of the failure omission risk due to the monitoring system has been shown. An equation of the static and dynamic errors relation, invariant to the nature of these processes and diagnostic features has been obtained. There have been obtained numerical estimates of the dynamic error increase for linear and exponential trends of technical state degradation in the objects, invariant to their nature. Ways of improving the monitoring systems for malfunctions in objects of different responsibility depends on the basis of a modernized classification criterion.},

As the discipline which focuses on enhancing human health and wellbeing, human factors and ergonomics (HFE) has a crucial role to play in the conception, design, and operation of AGI systems. Despite this, there has been little examination as to how HFE can influence and direct this evolution. This study uses a hypothetical AGI system, Tegmark's “Prometheus,” to frame the role of HFE in managing the risks associated with AGI. Fifteen categories of HFE method are identified and their potential role in AGI system design is considered. The findings suggest that all categories of HFE method can contribute to AGI system design; however, areas where certain methods require extension are identified. It is concluded that HFE can and should contribute to AGI system design and immediate effort is required to facilitate this goal. In closing, we explicate some of the work required to embed HFE in wider multi-disciplinary efforts aiming to create safe and efficient AGI systems. {\textcopyright} 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

abstract = {<p>With the wide propagation of handheld devices, more and more mobile sensors are being used by end users on a daily basis. Those sensors could be leveraged to gather useful mobility data for city planners, business analysts and researches. However, gathering and exploiting mobility data raises many privacy threats. Sensitive information such as one's home or work place, hobbies, religious beliefs, political or sexual preferences can be inferred from the gathered data. In the last decade, Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) have been proposed to protect user data privacy. However existing LPPMs fail at effectively protecting the users as most of them reason on local mobility features: micro-mobility (e.g., individual geographical coordinates) while ignoring higher level mobility features, which may allow attackers to discriminate between users. In this paper we propose HMC the first LPPM that reasons on the overall user mobility abstracted using heat maps. We evaluate HMC using four real mobility traces and multiple privacy and utility metrics. The results show that with HMC, across all the datasets 87% of mobile users are successfully protected against re-identification attacks, while others LPPMs only achieve a protection ranging from 43% to 79%. By considering only users protected with a high utility, the proportion of users stays high for HMC with 75%, while for others LPPMs it goes down to proportions between 4% and 43%.</p>},

abstract = {This paper presents a human reliability analysis (HRA) model that allows the incorporation of features related to facility conditions to determine human error probabilities (HEP) used in probabilistic safety analyses of process plants. We present an approach to show the predominance of human factors as an accident cause, as well as existing methodologies for HEP determination and their deficiencies in incorporating socio-technical elements that influence them. Such elements are: inappropriate design, training, procedures, communication, safety culture, management in the production process changes, emergency planning, accident investigation, environmental factors, maintenance workload and human-system interface. A mathematical model is proposed to incorporate these elements taking into account their contribution weights as well as measuring their degree of implementation in the plant. This creates a factor that can modify existing HEPs, giving values that better reflect plant reality. The model was applied to the accident that occurred in 1999 in Tokai-Mura, Japan. The modified HEP was 2 times greater than the nominal HEP. This shows that considering organizational factors thoroughly allows for a more realistic plant behavior modeling in face of abnormal events. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Pattern mining, that is, the automated discovery of patterns from data, is a mathematically complex and computationally demanding problem that is generally not manageable by humans. In this article, we focus on small datasets and study whether it is possible to mine patterns with the help of the crowd by means of a set of controlled experiments on a common crowdsourcing platform. We specifically concentrate on mining model patterns from a dataset of real mashup models taken from Yahoo! Pipes and cover the entire pattern mining process, including pattern identification and quality assessment. The results of our experiments show that a sensible design of crowdsourcing tasks indeed may enable the crowd to identify patterns from small datasets (40 models). The results, however, also show that the design of tasks for the assessment of the quality of patterns to decide which patterns to retain for further processing and use is much harder (our experiments fail to elicit assessments from the crowd that are similar to those by an expert). The problem is relevant in general to model-driven development (e.g., UML, business processes, scientific workflows), in that reusable model patterns encode valuable modeling and domain knowledge, such as best practices, organizational conventions, or technical choices, that modelers can benefit from when designing their own models.},

However, via a meta-review of 52 review papers covering related topics (published between 2000 and 2021), this paper shows a lack of a more recent literature review on user perspectives of smart home security and privacy since the 2010s. This identified gap motivated us to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) covering 126 relevant research papers published from 2010 to 2021. Our SLR led to the discovery of a number of important areas where further research is needed; these include holistic methods that consider a more diverse and heterogeneous range of home devices, interactions between multiple home users, complicated data flow between multiple home devices and home users, some less-studied demographic factors, and advanced conceptual frameworks. Based on these findings, we recommended key future research directions, e.g., research for a better understanding of security and privacy aspects in different multi-device and multi-user contexts, and a more comprehensive ontology on the security and privacy of the smart home covering varying types of home devices and behaviors of different types of home users.},

Verifying handwritten signatures manually causes too much human cost, and its high probability of errors can threaten the property safety and even society stability. Therefore, the need for an automatic verification system is emphasized. This paper proposes a device-free on-line handwritten signature verification system ASSV, providing paper-based handwritten signature verification service. As far as we know, ASSV is the first system which uses the changes of acoustic signals to realize signature verification. ASSV differs from previous on-line signature verification work in two aspects: 1. It requires neither a special sensor-instrumented pen nor a tablet; 2. People do not need to wear a device such as a smartwatch on the dominant hand for hand tracking. Differing from previous acoustic-based sensing systems, ASSV uses a novel chord-based method to estimate phase-related changes caused by tiny actions. Then based on the estimation, frequency-domain features are extracted by a discrete cosine transform (DCT). Moreover, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model fed with distance matrices is designed to verify signatures. Extensive experiments show that ASSV is a robust, efficient and secure system achieving an AUC of 98.7% and an EER of 5.5% with a low latency.},

However, human drivers and passengers have to trust and accept their use. This raises the question of how trust can be increased in such a scenario. One important factor for this is understanding the available information, including its quality and, for passengers of automated vehicles, the actions planned based on it. For this, augmented reality is a promising visualization technology because it can present the relevant information integrated into the physical world. Thus, this work develops a taxonomy of augmented reality visualizations for connected automated and manual driving. It is intended to classify and compare existing visualizations, identify novel visualizations, and provide a common language for discussions. The use case infrastructure-supported automated driving is explored by suggesting augmented reality visualizations to inform passengers of automated vehicles and are intended to increase trust. They present information available from infrastructure and onboard sensors as well as the driving decisions based on it. Finally, we evaluated the visualizations' influence on trust in an automated vehicle by conducting a driving simulator study (N=18). Results indicate a high dependency of trust on presenting driving decisions and information on road users but less on location-specific information.},

abstract = {The integration of information and industrial technologies, digitalization and differentiation of sciences are accompanied by an increase in various types of complexity. This limits the capabilities of computer modelling, data mining, and predictive analytics. The increasing cognitive complexity of information flows and their diversity creates problems of safety, reliability and stability of the functioning of a complex dynamic system in extreme conditions. Here we show the possibility of cognitive visualization of signals of different nature through their geometrization in the form of a topological 3D model of functioning. Its projections are spatio-temporal signatures, the configurations of which reflect the dynamic, energetic and structural features of the model. An increase in the number of components of the signature configuration and its area under external influence indicates an increase in structural and functional complexity. Therefore, the signal structure can be analyzed in real time using complementary probabilistic and deterministic methods. A set of tools for the synthesis and analysis of 3D models has innovative potential for monitoring the functioning of elements of complex dynamic systems, risk management and predictive analytics. {\textcopyright} 2021 WITPress.

abstract = {Weak control of human factors leads directly to error. An error can result in an initiating event of an accident sequence (directly by the mistake made or indirectly, such as by a process control loop failing prematurely). Human error is also the cause of failure of each layer of protection. This paper discusses each of the 10 primary human factors and describes what we know about their relative importance in accident causation. The data presented is from basic research by the authors on the root causes of more than 15,000 accidents and near misses; and also based on the review of thousands of accidents analyzed by others and on summary data from many companies. This paper lists where focus should be placed (i.e., which human factors tend to be key) and provides proven ways to optimize these human factors so that the base human error rate at a site is as low as possible. Tie in to other applications, such as determining the probability of human error for risk analysis is also presented. Case studies and examples are used to illustrate key points.

abstract = {The introduction of modern Smart Home Systems (SHSs) is redefining the way we perform everyday activities. Today, myriad SHS applications and the devices they control are widely available to users. Specifically, users can easily download and install the apps from vendor-specific app markets, or develop their own, to effectively implement their SHS solutions. However, despite their benefits, app-based SHSs unfold diverse security risks. Several attacks have already been reported to SHSs and current security solutions only consider smart home devices and apps individually to detect malicious actions, rather than the context of the SHS as a whole. Thus, the current security solutions applied to SHSs cannot capture user activities and sensor-device-user interactions in a holistic fashion. To address these limitations, in this article, we introduce Aegis+, a novel context-aware platform-independent security framework to detect malicious behavior in an SHS. Specifically, Aegis+ observes the states of the connected smart home entities (sensors and devices) for different user activities and usage patterns in an SHS and builds a contextual model to differentiate between malicious and benign behavior. We evaluated the efficacy and performance of Aegis+ in multiple smart home settings (i.e., single bedroom, double bedroom, duplex) and platforms (i.e., Samsung SmartThings, Amazon Alexa) where real users perform day-to-day activities using real SHS devices. We also measured the performance of Aegis+ against five different malicious behaviors. Our detailed evaluation shows that Aegis+ can detect malicious behavior in SHS with high accuracy (over 95%) and secure the SHS regardless of the smart home layout and platforms, device configurations, installed apps, controller devices, and enforced user policies. Finally, Aegis+ yields minimum overhead to the SHS, ensuring effective deployability in real-life smart environments.},

Hence, it is a challenging rather impossible to easily make security solutions to work an integrated fashion. Security orchestration aims at smoothly integrating multivendor security tools that can effectively and efficiently interoperate to support security staff of a Security Operation Centre (SOC). Given the increasing role and importance of security orchestration, there has been an increasing amount of literature on different aspects of security orchestration solutions. However, there has been no effort to systematically review and analyze the reported solutions. We report a Multivocal Literature Review that has systematically selected and reviewed both academic and grey (blogs, web pages, white papers) literature on different aspects of security orchestration published from January 2007 until July 2017. The review has enabled us to provide a working definition of security orchestration and classify the main functionalities of security orchestration into three main areas-unification, orchestration, and automation. We have also identified the core components of a security orchestration platform and categorized the drivers of security orchestration based on technical and socio-technical aspects. We also provide a taxonomy of security orchestration based on the execution environment, automation strategy, deployment type, mode of task and resource type. This review has helped us to reveal several areas of further research and development in security orchestration.},

abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is present in many participants from the energy, health, manufacturing, transport, and public sectors. Many factors catalyze IIoT, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and intelligent decentralized manufacturing. However, the convergence between IT, OT, and IoT environments involves the integration of heterogeneous technologies through protocols, standards, and buses. However, this integration brings with it security risks. To avoid the security risks, especially when systems in different environments interact, it is important and urgent to create an early consensus among the stakeholders on the IIoT security. The default Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) offers a mechanism to measure the severity of an asset's vulnerability and therefore a way to characterize the risk. However, CVSS by default has two drawbacks. On the one hand, to carry out a risk analysis, it is necessary to have additional metrics to the one established by CVSSv3.1. On the other hand, this index has been used mostly in IT environments and although there are numerous efforts to develop a model that suits industrial environments, there is no established proposal. Therefore, we first propose a survey of the main 33 protocols, standards, and buses used in an IIoT environment. This survey will focus on the security of each one. The second part of our study consists of the creation of a framework to characterize risk in industrial environments, i.e., to solve both problems of the CVSS index. To this end, we created the Vulnerability Analysis Framework (VAF), which is a methodology that allows the analysis of 1,363 vulnerabilities to establish a measure to describe the risk in IIoT environments.},

abstract = {Machine-learned computer vision algorithms for tagging images are increasingly used by developers and researchers, having become popularized as easy-to-use "cognitive services." Yet these tools struggle with gender recognition, particularly when processing images of women, people of color and non-binary individuals. Socio-technical researchers have cited data bias as a key problem; training datasets often over-represent images of people and contexts that convey social stereotypes. The social psychology literature explains that people learn social stereotypes, in part, by observing others in particular roles and contexts, and can inadvertently learn to associate gender with scenes, occupations and activities. Thus, we study the extent to which image tagging algorithms mimic this phenomenon. We design a controlled experiment, to examine the interdependence between algorithmic recognition of context and the depicted person's gender. In the spirit of auditing to understand machine behaviors, we create a highly controlled dataset of people images, imposed on gender-stereotyped backgrounds. Our methodology is reproducible and our code publicly available. Evaluating five proprietary algorithms, we find that in three, gender inference is hindered when a background is introduced. Of the two that "see" both backgrounds and gender, it is the one whose output is most consistent with human stereotyping processes that is superior in recognizing gender. We discuss the accuracy--fairness trade-off, as well as the importance of auditing black boxes in better understanding this double-edged sword.},

abstract = {Fatalities continue to plague the construction industry. To address this ongoing concern, researchers have begun to develop and test proactive methods to improve construction safety, such as risk analysis, leading indicators, and predictive analytics. The present study aims to build upon these current methodologies by creating and testing the first objective precursor-analysis program for construction fatalities. Specifically, the following hypothesis was tested: The probability of fatal and disabling events can be predicted by a small number of precursors that can be identified prior to an incident. Testing this hypothesis involved obtaining case data using a precursor-analysis protocol described in the companion to this paper, using principal component analysis to reduce the dimensions of the data set, building a mathematical predictive model using generalized linear modeling, and testing the predictive validity of the model with independent validation cases. The results indicated that there are 16 principal precursors that, when organized into a generalized linear model, are able to predict the outcome of new cases far better than random (p<0.001). With further validation and testing, this new methodology can serve as the foundation for the first objective and valid precursor-analysis program for construction. Such a program will enable the construction industry to predict the potential for a high-impact event during construction operations and ultimately improve its safety performance. {\textcopyright} 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

However, due to the socioeconomic backgrounds, the characteristics of construction accidents vary from different countries or districts. The purpose of this study is to identify the spatiotemporal characteristics of fatal construction accidents in China and to explore the causes related with behavioral factors. With the data of 4,061 fatal construction accidents in China, the spatial and temporal features were examined. The behavioral factors were also analyzed applying the technique of human factor analysis and classification system (HFACS). The results show that the numbers of accidents and fatalities differ greatly by months, weeks, hours, provinces, and regions. These differences may be affected by various organizational, managerial, and individual factors. Behavioral factors are critical for 4 main types of accidents: fall, object striking, collapse, and hoisting injury. 23 common unsafe behaviors such as failure to detect warning signs of accidents in time are explored related with these accidents. The results indicate that safety practitioners should pay attention to the spatiotemporal variances of construction accidents and focus on the behavioral factors. The flexible safety plans involving more human factors may be necessary in order to reduce construction accidents and to keep the sites safer. {\textcopyright} 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Smartphone information security awareness describes the knowledge, attitude and behaviour that employees apply to the security of the organisational information that they access, process and store on their smartphone devices. The surge in the number of smartphone devices connecting to organisational systems and used to process organisational data has enabled a new level of operational efficiency. While employees are aware of the benefits they enjoy by bringing their personal devices into the workplace, managers too are aware of the benefits of having a constantly connected workforce. Unfortunately, those aware of the risks to information security do not share an equal level of enthusiasm. These devices are owned by employees who are not adequately skilled to configure the security settings for acceptable security of that information. Moreover, routine information security awareness programmes, even if applied, gradually fade into the daily rush of operations from the day they are completed. This paper explores the factors which influence these oscillating levels of information security awareness. By applying an adapted version of an awareness model from the domain of accident prevention, the factors which cause diminishing awareness levels are exposed. Subsequently, information security awareness emerges as a symptom of such factors. Through geometrical modelling of the boundaries and pressures that govern our daily operations, an awareness model emerges. This model ensures that organisations are better equipped to monitor their information security awareness position, their boundaries and the daily pressures affecting the organisation, thus allowing them to design better integrated policies and procedures to encourage safe operating limits. The model is evaluated using a theory evaluation framework through an expert review process. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The objective of this paper is to report on an exploratory research study assessing the safety culture and human factor awareness in a large European port environment. The research study adopted a multi-methods approach that included the completion of a Safety Culture Assessment Survey across a port environment (161 responses) and research interviews (11 in total) with a port authority company. The research concludes that there is an increasing awareness of human factors and a move towards a positive safety culture that facilitates an open and resilient approach to all safety practices. However much more focused research is required focusing on the specific complexities, constraints and shared processes of our port environments. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Many developing countries are making substantial progress toward the MDGs as a result of improved policies, better governance, and the productive use of development assistance. But they could do more with the right mix of policy reforms and additional help. Scaling up efforts to meet the MDGs by 2015 presents both opportunities and challenges. By acting now, developed countries can hasten progress by providing more and better aid and by allowing greater access to their markets. Developing countries, for their part, will need to continue to improve their policies and the way they are implemented. Without greater impetus, there is a serious risk that many countries will fall far short on many of the goals. These findings emerge from a recent World Bank study that looked at how progress toward the MDGs at the country level could be accelerated through a combination of better domestic policies and improved governance, higher aid levels (in terms of official development assistance), more effective aid delivery, and improved market access to developed country markets. The study focused on 18 countries that account for approximately half of the world's poor and a third of global aid flows and are broadly representative of low-income countries with good policies. The 18 are Albania, Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Honduras, India, Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Pakistan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Vietnam.

Despite major efforts to pursue a safe nuclear energy system in the first nuclear era, severe nuclear accidents occurred. A basic problem is that we do not have an adequate understanding of nuclear safety. From the viewpoints of risk and the close coupling of technical and social factors, this paper reexamines the nature of nuclear safety and reviews how previous experts understood it. We also highlight the new challenges that we are likely to confront in the unexpected second nuclear era and clarify some of the refinements that need to be made to the concept of nuclear safety from a sociotechnical perspective. These include the following: 1) Risk decisions should be made based on integrating social and technical elements (i.e., "social rationality"); 2) risk needs to be controlled based on the "Wuli-Shili-Renli" framework; 3) systems thinking should be substituted for reductionism in risk assessment, and social mechanisms need to be combined to address uncertainties; and 4) public-centered risk communication should be established. This contribution can provide a theoretical foundation for improving our understanding of the nature of nuclear safety and for transforming the concept of nuclear safety in the unexpected second nuclear era. {\textcopyright} 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

abstract = {The library of methods available for analysis of system safety is vast and still growing. So which are best used to address any particular problem? To help researchers and practitioners address this question, this paper places the plethora of system safety approaches into historical context in a way that demonstrates the uses of each. Safety first became an explicit consideration for system designers during World War II. At that time, safety was analyzed from a quantitative perspective, an approach that dominated for decades. By the 1980s, several catastrophic accidents, including Three Mile Island and the Space Shuttle Challenger, stimulated a flurry of research on human and organizational causes. Recently, researchers have developed systems-oriented frameworks to analyze safety from a more holistic perspective. To make sense of the multifaceted history of system safety, the paper traces the historical timeline in terms of the events and research findings that led to the frameworks, methods, and tools that exist today. Beginning with the story of the Manhattan Project, the paper journeys through the history of system safety and sheds light on the origins of quantitative techniques, qualitative risk assessments, engineering design methods, human factors methods, organizational frameworks and systems approaches to safety. {\textcopyright} 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

Three phenotype responses were integrated, based on FRAM, namely timing, precision, and duration. The ergonomics approach was used to identify process functions by observing the operator workday to FRAM. A methodological framework based on human factors had selected the critical key PSF, used as an indicator, to identify the critical activities in the process, by operator's perceptions. This study demonstrated that some result variability couplings can be different in some aspects in the automated and batch process. The integration of duration phenotypes with integration time and precision can modify the results of variability in the batch process. Human being management adapts and mitigates the risk. Operator competence and knowledge can eliminate function and task time by modifying the work sequence of the process. Comparison of analytical results demonstrated the compatibility of the two analyses.  {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {This article concludes a longitudinal study with the broader aim to explore learner development as a longterm, social process. One goal has been to inform the endeavours of improving student engagement, retention, as well as under-representation of certain demographics in computing. Students of two computer science-related study programmes (CS/IT) reflected on their engagement in their field of study at different times during the first three study years. Drawing on social identity theory, the focus has been to analyse and describe different ways in which the students experience participation in CS/IT, i.e., doing, thinking, and feeling, in relation to CS/IT, negotiated among different people. Insights into participation in CS/IT were used to discuss what it entails to fit in and become a computing professional. Phenomenographic analysis yields an outcome space that describes increasingly broad ways in which first-, second-, and third-year students experience participation in CS/IT. Two further outcome spaces provide nuanced insights into experiences that are of increasing relevance as the students advance in their studies, participation as problem solving, and problem solving for others. Participation as problem solving appears to be central in this learning environment and the students integrate such experiences into their histories of engagement in CS/IT. In study year 3, the students also reason about participation as problem solving for others that they encounter in the human computer interaction course. However, at that time several students perform a technical problem solver identity and reject such broader ways of participating in CS/IT.},

abstract = {This paper provides the empirical basis to support predictions of the Human Factor Engineering (HFE) influences in Human Reliability Analysis (HRA). A few methods were analyzed to identify HFE concepts in approaches of Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs): Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP), Human Cognitive Reliability (HCR) and Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method (CREAM), Success Likelihood Index Method (SLIM) Plant Analysis Risk - Human Reliability Analysis (SPAR-H), A Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (ATHEANA) and Man-Machine-Organization System Analysis (MMOSA). Also, in order to identify other necessary PSFs in HFE, an additional investigation process of human performance (HPIP) in event occurrences was used. Thus, the human error probability could be reduced and its evaluating can give out the information for error detection and recovery. The HFE analysis model developed using BHEP values (maximum and pessimistic) is based on the simplifying assumption that all specific circumstances of HFE characteristics are equal in importance and have the same value of influence on human performance. This model is incorporated into the PSA through the HRA methodology. Finally, a clarification of the relationships between task analysis and the HFE is performed, ie between potential human errors and design requirements.  {\textcopyright} 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston, Germany.},

abstract = {Background/Objectives: The article analyzes the information security from the standpoint of causes triggering the vulnerabilities of information technologies and systems. Methods/Statistical analysis: Information technologies are based on three interdependent components, namely, hardware, software and human resource (Figure 1). The susceptibility of final technologies to a number of threats challenging the information security takes roots in each of the abovementioned aspects both taken separately and in their complex combination. Findings: Data processing centers constitute a way to centralize the resources of the organizations' information infrastructure. Implementing such centers increases the system reliability and information availability in the whole and reduces the loading of the data transmission network at the organization. Meanwhile, data processing centers are an expensive option, and not every company can afford it. In addition to it, efficient foundation and functioning of such centers require highly qualified personnel. Modern information systems suffer from security imperfections. The main cause of their vulnerabilities roots in their complexity connected to the fact that information systems consist of a number of interrelated components which are designed and produced separately by different working teams. With the development of the civilization, the complexity increases steadily, therefore there is a burning need in working out measures. Applications/Improvements: May be used as guidance in order to improve the quality of testing the components of information systems and their compatibility.},

abstract = {The significant growth of banking fraud, fueled by the underground economy of malware, has raised the need for effective detection systems. Therefore, in the last few years, banks have upgraded their security to protect transactions from fraud. State-of-the-art solutions detect fraud as deviations from customers' spending habits. To the best of our knowledge, almost all existing approaches do not provide an in-depth model's granularity and security analysis against elusive attacks. In this article, we examine Banksealer, a decision support system for banking fraud analysis that evaluates the influence on detection performance of the granularity at which spending habits are modeled and its security against evasive attacks. First, we compare user-centric modeling, which builds a model for each user, with system-centric modeling, which builds a model for the entire system, from the point of view of detection performance. Then, we assess the robustness of Banksealer against malicious attackers that are aware of the structure of the models in use. To this end, we design and implement a proof-of-concept attack tool that performs mimicry attacks, emulating a sophisticated attacker that cloaks frauds to avoid detection. We experimentally confirm the feasibility of such attacks, their cost, and the effort required by an attacker in order to perform them. In addition, we discuss possible countermeasures. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on a large real-world dataset obtained from one of the largest Italian banks.},

abstract = {Industry 4.0 systems in general and advanced manufacturing systems such as collaborative robots, in particular, are characterized by a high level of complexity leading to new safety concerns. Safety, specifically for collaborative robots, has been mainly addressed from a technical perspective, to safeguard the physical safety of the operator. Concerns have been raised regarding less focus in Industry 4.0 literature on how other factors, such as psychosocial can produce safety-related risks for the operator in human-robot collaboration. This paper identifies and classifies the risk factors in a human-robot collaboration that have been described in research papers in the last decade. The resulting five classes constitute dimensions that will be used as preliminary building blocks for a safety evaluation framework to be developed in the next step. By evaluating the resulting classes with the underlying dimensions of contemporary socio-technical thinking, this paper demonstrates that these five classes offer a comprehensive, system-wide perspective including risk factors beyond technological considerations. Topics emerging from new risks related to the impact of working with collaborative robots, such as psychosocial, ethical, and cyber risk factors will need to be taken into account in the risk factors that are important to identify, assess and mitigate before working with collaborative robots. Operator involvement and participation, especially throughout the risk assessment and mitigation cycle are recommended as new areas of attention in human-robot collaboration. Going forward, one challenge will be the agility and adaptability of legislation to at least keep track of risk factors emerging from continuously changing technologies and to translate them into practically applicable tools for enterprises and design engineers implementing collaborative applications. Another key challenge will be the measurement of the new emerging and sometimes less technological risks. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Direct viewing tasks associated with observing the Platform Train Interface (PTI) requires detailed inspection of large areas, in short timescales whilst the driver/guard is under time pressure. However, as visual detection tasks are safety critical (if not done properly there is a risk of passengers being trapped between PTI). This paper discuss the technical approach that was undertaken as part of a safety assessment to validate and verify that Guards could be relocated from the centre of the train (4th car) to the rear of the train (8th car) and undertake PTI viewing with CCTV instead of the current method of direct viewing. The assessment was undertaken to assure that detection of PTI events was more reliable using CCTV when compared to direct viewing. The resulting study included a detailed literature review, a structured technical rationale report and CCTV assessment trials to assure that the proposed CCTV systems performance reduced PTI risks to ALARP. The literature review included UK rail CCTV guidance documents and documents from other industries (e.g. security). The extensive literature review found that none of the existing CCTV guidance available was directly applicable, robust enough or of suitable rigour. Therefore, a number of specific technical issues were systematically assessed with input from CCTV Engineering specialists. This elicited a large number of technical and Human Factors issues that had not been found to be addressed by any other Human Factors studies in the Rail sector. The outcome of the assessment/literature review was derivation of a detailed CCTV specification for the CCTV suppliers. The CCTV system was subsequently built and trialled on Sydney Trains Suburban Network under a variety of environmental and operational scenarios. The resulting CCTV trial assessed camera and lens performance in terms of a number of technical factors and evaluated the CCTV system on test runs with live trains on the suburban network under a variety of scenarios. The overall safety assessment found that CCTV offered performance of PTI tasks as robust (and in some scenarios better) when compared to direct viewing. The safety assessment concluded that CCTV viewing from the rear car offered as good as (if not better) probabilities of detecting PTI events when compared to direct viewing from the 4th car. The CCTV system is now operational on a number of Sydney Suburban Trains. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.},

abstract = {Ethylene treaters are widely used in the petrochemical industry to remove impurities from ethylene feedstock imported from pipeline networks or storage caverns. The safety concerns of dense phase ethylene treaters due to the reactive and highly flammable nature of ethylene are well known and studied. Under certain conditions, ethylene may self-polymerize and decompose violently with heat release. Under other conditions, ethylene will auto-refrigerate, generating cold liquids that may cause potential brittle fracture hazards. Therefore, dense phase ethylene treaters present design challenges with the unique combination of high temperature decomposition and cold temperature brittle fracture hazards. Due to these safety concerns, it is important to select the appropriate engineering design options for dense phase ethylene treaters and the associated regeneration facilities. Totally automated treater regeneration systems add complexity and instrument maintenance requirements while manually operated systems rely heavily on operator training and procedures. Unfortunately, little or no information or design guidance is available from published research findings in the literature on the evaluation and risk assessment of current industrial design options and practices for dense phase ethylene treaters. This paper presents a systematic risk assessment method to evaluate the engineering design and safe operation options for dense phase ethylene treaters. The proposed risk assessment method integrates human factors task analysis into the traditional HAZOP, LOPA and fault tree analysis to allow evaluation of automated, manual and hybrid approaches with a goal of selecting and optimizing design options to ensure plant safety. This approach provides a realistic assessment of the operational risk and allows identification of fit-for-purpose risk reduction. Applying this systematic risk assessment approach, a simpler and more cost effective design solution can be justified, thereby avoiding the need for a high integrity protective system. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Background: Nowadays, service-oriented architectures and cloud-based infrastructures are widely used in manufacturing industries and IT organizations. These architectures and infrastructures are based on shared system resources. In some organizations, system resources like a printer, photocopy machines, and scanners are also shared among the members of the organization. The purpose of the proposed work is to model various types of shared system resources, shared system resources based architecture/infrastructure and analyze the model to identify the possible security risk associated with shared system resources and shared system resources based architecture/infrastructure. Design Approach: To model shared system resources and shared system resources based architecture/Infrastructure, Petri net and its variations are used. For security analysis of the Petri net based model of the shared system resource, Petri net algebra based concepts are applied. Results: The present paper successfully demonstrates that the proposed Petri net based modeling approach can be used for quantitative and qualitative security analysis of shared system resources and shared system resources based architecture/infrastructure. For quantitative analysis of security risk associated with shared system resources, information theoretic concepts are used. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, case studies are also incorporated in the present paper. The proposed approach can take various security risk factors like timing analysis attack, information leakage due to confidentiality policy violation and power analysis attack into the consideration while analyzing the security of shared system resources in the industrial environment. {\textcopyright} 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We assessed whether MT performed on single-plane (SP) is equivalent in terms of safety, effectiveness, radiation and contrast agent exposure. Consecutive patients treated by MT in four high volume centers between January 2014 and May 2017 were included. Demographic and MT characteristics were assessed and compared between SP and BP. Of 906 patients treated by MT, 576 (64%) were handled on a BP system. After multivariate analysis, contrast load and fluoroscopy duration were significantly lower in the BP group [100vs200mL, relative effect 0.85 (CI: 0.79–0.92), p = 0.0002; 22 vs 27 min, relative effect 0.84 (CI: 0.76–0.93), p = 0.0008, respectively]. There was no difference in recanalization (modified Thrombolysis-In-Cerebral-Infarction 2b-3), good clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0–2), complications rates, procedure duration or radiation exposure. A three-vessel diagnostic angiogram performed prior to MT led to a significant increase in procedure duration (15% increase, p = 0.05), radiation exposure (33% increase, p < 0.0001) and contrast load (125% increase, p < 0.0001).

In this paper, we investigated the factors contributing to the failurein the IT system of the banking industry in Bangladesh. Based on the experts' opinions and weight on the specified evaluating criteria, an empirical test was conducted using a rough set theory to produce a framework for the IT system failure factors. In this study, an extended approach involving the integration of rough set theory based flexible Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) has beenapplied to help the managers of the corresponding field to identify the factors responsible for the failure of the IT system in the banking industries and then prioritize them accordingly, for the ease of decision- making.In this research, eleven such failure factors were identified, which were then quantitatively analyzed to facilitate managers in crucial decision-making. It was observed that cyber-attack, database hack risks, server failure, network interruption, broadcast data error, and virus effect were the most significant factors for the failure of the IT system. The framework developed in this research can be utilized to assist in efficient decision-makingin other serviceindustries where IT systems play a key role. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first study thatempirically tested key failure factors of the IT system for the banking sector using an integrated method.  {\textcopyright} 2022 Ali et al.

This investigation includes defined methods and the factors to assess undergoing efforts of environment threats associated with complex networked systems in aviation through analysis design activities with machine learning. The ability to examine the analysis design allows learners in engineering education to deploy methods that will assess the combination of techniques and security consideration through machine learning. This project comprised of a collected dataset of network traces and malicious traffic that requires a solution and strategic model based on various scenarios to improve the software architecture design. Aviation safety and security standards are critical to the degree in which threats are constituted as each node within the network determined specific case studies for evaluation. This approach will feature a dataset that assess the spam detection categorization from a human behavior perspective and the factors to formulate data mining techniques and models in R programming language. The framework adopts the use of logistic regression and proposed techniques of the performance baseline to explore a systematic approach in the engineering design process. PBL in engineering education revealed a viewpoint from interdisciplinary approach as this study will have a wide range of features in the design analysis (e.g., revealing unwanted electronic information spread causing concerns and environmental threats to the aviation community). This study is developed to examine a common framework for processing and structuring a model using logistic regression analysis to classify key elements in the engineering process and PBL activities.  {\textcopyright} 2021 IEEE.},

INTRODUCTION In this paper, we will address the important question of how quality improvement science (QIS) and human factors and ergonomics (HFE) can work together to produce safer solutions for healthcare. We suggest that there will be considerable advantages from an integrated approach between the two disciplines and professions which could be achieved in two phases. First, by identifying people trained in HFE and those trained in QIS who understand how to work together and second, by developing opportunities for integrated education and training. To develop this viewpoint we will:},

abstract = {In the field of traffic safety, the occurrence of accidents remains a cause of concern for road regulators as well as users. Exploring risk factors inducing the accidents and quantifying the accident risk will not only benefit the prevention and control of traffic accidents but also assist in developing effective risk propagation model for road accidents. This study uses detailed accident record data to mine the risk factors affecting the occurrence of accidents, and quantify the accident risk under the combination of risk factors. First, by reviewing relevant literature and analyzing historical accident, we construct a multi-dimension characterization framework of risk factors with bi-level structure. The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) is applied to supplement and improve the framework. Next, under this framework, we identify the risk factors in traffic accident record, and analyze the statistical characteristics from the level of risk sources and risk characteristics. Then, the concept of accident liability weight is proposed to measure the impact of risk factors on accident occurrence. Through the liability affirmation of risk factors, the accident probability are updated. Last, we establish an accident risk quantify model (ARQM) based on the mean mutual information to compare the likelihood of accidents in different scenarios. In addition, we compare the accident probability and risk under equivalent liability and liability affirmation, as well as give some fundamental ideas regarding how to effectively prevent accidents. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In this paper, the research results of the human-robot collaboration study for the case of an automotive brake disc assembly is presented. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed as a decision-making method for the human-robot collaboration system, and detailed hierarchical task analysis (HTA) is applied to allocate operational tasks to humans and robots, thus reducing the chance of duty interference. Additionally, a virtual environment software (Tecnomatix Process Simulate, version 11.1,80, Siemens, Munich, BY, Germany, 2012) is used to model the assembly workstation, providing an opportunity to evaluate the feasibility of the process through different scenarios. Finally, an experimental test is conducted to evaluate the performance of the assembly procedure. This research proves that, although human-robot collaboration increases the total process time slightly, this collaboration improves human ergonomics considerably and reduces the operator injury risk.},

abstract = {Risk management in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry is a global issue. Failure to adequately manage risks may not only lead to difficulties in meeting project objectives but also influence land-use planning and urban spatial design in the future growth of cities. Due to the rapid development and adoption of BIM (Building Information Modelling) and BIM-related digital technologies, the use of these technologies for risk management has become a growing research trend leading to a demand for a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of these developments. This paper presents a summary of traditional risk management, and a comprehensive and extensive review of published literature concerning the latest efforts of managing risk using technologies, such as BIM, automatic rule checking, knowledge based systems, reactive and proactive IT (information technology)-based safety systems. The findings show that BIM could not only be utilised to support the project development process as a systematic risk management tool, but it could also serve as a core data generator and platform to allow other BIM-based tools to perform further risk analysis. Most of the current efforts have concentrated on investigating technical developments, and the management of construction personnel safety has been the main interest so far. Because of existing technical limitations and the lack of “human factor” testing, BIM-based risk management has not been commonly used in real environments. In order to overcome this gap, future research is proposed that should: (1) have a multi-disciplinary system-thinking, (2) investigate implementation methods and processes, (3) integrate traditional risk management with new technologies, and (4) support the development process. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {In order to effectively assess all types of security risks in the important event, the important decision-making basis for security risk warning and emergency management of important event is provided by analyzing the coupling relationship and evolution mechanism between various risks. The criminal causes, management defects, security and emergency system construction are analyzed from the possibility of accidents and risks. The multi-source data risk assessment system based on five subsystems and its index set of human factors, management factors, site factors, event factors and audit factors are proposed. The weight of each index in the assessment system is determined by the method of information entropy, and then the risk grade of important event is determined according to the weight calculation function and the improved fuzzy matter element model. The verification with an example shows that: the risk assessment model is optimized by combining entropy weight with fuzzy matter-element model, the influence of weight data extreme value was weakened, the qualitative description and quantitative analysis of multi-source data could be combined, and the subjective error was reduced. The risk grade of important event is reasonably evaluated, and the assessment effect is basically consistent with the expert inspection analysis, which shows that the method had certain application value. {\textcopyright} 2022, The Author(s).},

Although such assistive technologies are already collecting and sharing such information with VIPs, the views, perceptions, and preferences of sighted bystanders about such information sharing remain unexplored. Although bystanders may be willing to share more information for assistive uses it remains to be explored to what degree bystanders are willing to share various kinds of information and what might encourage additional sharing of information based on the contextual needs of VIPs. In this paper we describe the first empirical study of information sharing preferences of sighted bystanders of assistive devices. We conducted a survey based study using a contextual method of inquiry with 62 participants followed by nine semi-structured interviews to shed more insight on our key quantitative findings. We find that bystanders are more willing to share some kinds of personal information with VIPs and are willing to share additional information if higher security assurances can be made by improving their control over how their information is shared.},

Particularly, as novel techniques (e.g., social engineering and phishing) are aimed at leveraging individual users' vulnerabilities to attack and breach a larger system or an entire company, user awareness and behavior have become key factors in preventing adverse events, mitigating their damage, and responding appropriately. As a result, the concept of Cyber Hygiene (CH) is becoming increasingly relevant to address the risk associated to an individual's CS practices. Consequently, self-assessment tools are becoming more important for evaluating user's literacy, implementing measures (e.g., training), and studying the effectiveness of interventions.

The next age in connectivity is the IoT. With the IoT, smart devices may be engaged to render and exchange knowledge both reliably and efficiently. Distinctive IoT advances center around robotizing different undertakings and trying to empower the working of the lifeless physical structures without human mediation. While convenience is at the bleeding edge of advancing the acknowledgment and utilization of these net assets and the focal point of training; security and protection are regularly post-thoroughly considered. As a consequence, there is a dangerous climate of potential for malicious attackers to hack compromised devices while sitting in homes. Recent history demonstrates that an assault on IoT devices will be both simple and also have obliterating effects. Current and future IoT technologies are very encouraging for the user to increase levels of comfort, performance, and automation. It needs high security, anonymity, authentication, and recovery of assault to be able to integrate such an environment in an ever-increasing manner. In the above context, to accomplish start to finish IoT conditions, it is imperative to make the vital enhancements in structure of the IoT framework.

Data-driven thematic analysis was used to identify the most salient themes within each definition, sector, and cyber expert group as a whole with results compared to current standards definitions. Network analysis was employed to visualize the interconnection of salient themes within and across sectors and disciplines. When examined as a whole group, “context-driven,” “resilient system functionality,” and “maintenance of CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability)” were the most salient themes and influential network nodes for the definition of cyber security, while “impacts of CIA vulnerabilities,” “probabilities of outcomes,” and “context-driven” were the most salient themes for cyber security risk.

abstract = {Risk acceptance decisions are essential in any risk management system. However, in occupational environments, this is a problematic and challenging issue, since there are several factors that can influence the decision-making process regarding risk acceptance. This theoretical work aims to analyze the main factors that play an important role in the risk acceptance in occupational environments, through a literature review. This study showed that risk acceptance seems to be affected by several factors: risk and benefits, organizational and personal factors. Regarding the organizational factors, dimensions such as safety climate, safety culture and work flexibility can be considered. Moreover, some important personal factors can also be considered. Thus, risk acceptance decisions can contain moral judgments, values, ethical concerns and emotions. It also can be influenced by trust and perception of risks and benefits. This study shows that the influence of these factors can lead to several discrepancies in the risk acceptance decisions among the different countries, organizations, managers and employees. Therefore, risks are accepted based on its acceptance conditions. This study also shows the need of involving all stakeholders in order to eliminate the limitations of individual decisions, and to make the risk acceptance process more effective and, consequently, improve the performance of the safety management system. More studies regarding the implications the factors analyzed in the risk acceptance decisions for in occupational environments are needed. Copyright {\textcopyright} (2012) by IAPSAM & ESRA.},

abstract = {Our research aims to highlight and alleviate the complex tensions around online safety, privacy, and smartphone usage in families so that parents and teens can work together to better manage mobile privacy and security-related risks. We developed a mobile application ("app") for Community Oversight of Privacy and Security ("CO-oPS") and had parents and teens assess whether it would be applicable for use with their families. CO-oPS is an Android app that allows a group of users to co-monitor the apps installed on one another's devices and the privacy permissions granted to those apps. We conducted a study with 19 parent-teen (ages 13-17) pairs to understand how they currently managed mobile safety and app privacy within their family and then had them install, use, and evaluate the CO-oPS app. We found that both parents and teens gave little consideration to online safety and privacy before installing new apps or granting privacy permissions. When using CO-oPS, participants liked how the app increased transparency into one another's devices in a way that facilitated communication, but were less inclined to use features for in-app messaging or to hide apps from one another. Key themes related to power imbalances between parents and teens surfaced that made co-management challenging. Parents were more open to collaborative oversight than teens, who felt that it was not their place to monitor their parents, even though both often believed parents lacked the technological expertise to monitor themselves. Our study sheds light on why collaborative practices for managing online safety and privacy within families may be beneficial but also quite difficult to implement in practice. We provide recommendations for overcoming these challenges based on the insights gained from our study.},

Firms and government see real costs associated with a failure to come to grips with data, security priorities, lost profits and general socio-economic impacts. As firms begin to turn to buying insurance policies to mitigate data breach liabilities, lower premium will increasingly be tied to employee associated risk factors.

abstract = {Nuclear power plants, being complex technological systems, represent a source of increased risk, in particular, a specific risk of radiation exposure. Obtaining quantitative assessments of radiation risk is critical for risk reduction and accident prevention. Existing methods for assessing radiation risk do not take into account the influence of external factors, such as population composition, geographical features, anthropogenic environmental changes, etc. The result of the risk analysis is the assessment of physical and economic indicators for the Rostov and Kalinin NPPs, taking into account the age composition of the population, as the most significant parameter. Based on a comparison of the estimates obtained with the results without taking into account the age distribution, recommendations are given on the use of adjusted estimates when developing measures to reduce risk and mitigate the consequences for the most sensitive age groups of the population (1-12 years). The objective of the work is to modify the methodological approach to the calculation of radiation risk indicators of the population, taking into account the age composition and the practical application of the formulas for assessing the physical and economic indicators of damage to real objects.

abstract = {Recent mobile communication developments and the penetration of smartphones are spurring the increase of the number of smart devices owned by individuals. Mobile devices, because of the multitude of services they provide other than simple communication have become deeply rooted into each individual's life. This development has spread into the work environment spawning a new trend commonly known as BYOD (bring your own device). However, with this trend serious security issues are emerging as a diversity of personal devices with unreliable security are increasingly accessing the typically closed intranets of conventional work environments. Corporations want to improve their productivity by taking advantage of the benefits of BYOD but it is difficult to handle an open BYOD work environment with current security technologies. This study analyzes the characteristics of BYOD environments, current threats to security and required security technologies, and presents a security framework suitable for BYOD environments. The framework presented here can manage a variety of devices despite their disparate operating systems and also control network factors according to the nature of the habits of BYOD users. As it is not based on IP or port-based analysis, which had been primarily used in the past, but on high quality, context information. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {Digital money drives modern economies, and the global adoption of mobile phones has enabled a wide range of digital financial services in the developing world. Where there is money, there must be security, yet prior work on mobile money has identified discouraging vulnerabilities in the current ecosystem. We begin by arguing that the situation is not as dire as it may seem - many reported issues can be resolved by security best practices and updated mobile software. To support this argument, we diagnose the problems from two directions: (1) a large-scale analysis of existing financial service products and (2) a series of interviews with 7 developers and designers in Africa and South America. We frame this assessment within a novel, systematic threat model. In our large-scale analysis, we evaluate 197 Android apps and take a deeper look at 71 products to assess specific organizational practices. We conclude that although attack vectors are present in many apps, service providers are generally making intentional, security-conscious decisions. The developer interviews support these findings, as most participants demonstrated technical competency and experience, and all worked within established organizations with regimented code review processes and dedicated security teams. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {Human operators will increasingly team with autonomous systems in military and security settings, for example, evaluation and analysis of threats. Determining whether humans are threatening is a particular challenge to which future autonomous systems may contribute. Optimal trust calibration is critical for mission success, but most trust research has addressed conventional automated systems of limited intelligence. This article identifies multiple factors that may influence trust in autonomous systems. Trust may be undermined by various sources of demand and uncertainty. These include the cognitive demands resulting from the complexity and unpredictability of the system, “social” demands resulting from the system's capacity to function as a team-member, and self-regulative demands associated with perceived threats to personal competence. It is proposed that existing gaps in trust research may be addressed using simulation methodologies. A simulated environment developed by the research team is described. It represents a “town-clearing” task in which the human operator teams with a robot that can be equipped with various sensors, and software for intelligent analysis of sensor data. The functionality of the simulator is illustrated, together with future research directions. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

IoT is essentially a combination of constrained devices that share sensitive data with each other without human involvement. Various security and privacy concerns exist with such a large number of connected devices, as they have low inbuilt resources. Hence, it is imperative to provide security solutions for such devices to secure them. This implies that the authentication factor protects the security and privacy of these devices and data by playing a vital role in data integrity. We have been analyzed in this paper the various lightweight solutions with the authentication requirements in IoT applications. This study has indicated that the top security issue is to provide less computation and be resistant to attacks, such as replay attacks, man-in-the-middle, forgery and chosen-ciphertext attacks, and denial of service (DoS) attacks. {\textcopyright} 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Organisations and security professionals design Security Education, Training, and Awareness (SETA) programs to improve cybersecurity behaviour, but they are often poorly received by employees. To understand employee negative perceptions of SETA programs, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 Australian employees regarding their experiences with both SETA programs and non-cybersecurity related workplace training. As expected, employees had a generally poor view of SETA programs. They reported that the same factors that are important for effective non-cybersecurity training are also important for SETA programs, such as management role modelling and well-designed workplace systems. However, the level of importance of these factors differed across the two contexts. For example, employees indicated that the misbehaviour of their colleagues is a more important factor for their appraisal of a SETA program than it is for a non-cybersecurity workplace training program. Our results suggest that employee perceptions of SETA programs relate to their previously held beliefs about cybersecurity threats, the content and delivery of the training program, the behaviour of others around them, and features of their organisation. From an applied perspective, these findings can explain why employees often do not engage with cybersecurity training material, and how their current beliefs can influence their receptivity for future training. {\textcopyright} 2021},

Further, construction companies have spent immeasurable resources on executing SMSs in the past 30 years. In this study, current industry practices were was reviewed to identify the benefits and obstacles of implementing SMS. Further, a questionnaire was conducted to identify the significant benefits and obstacles of implementing SMS. Results show that the top four benefits were safer working conditions, reduced harm to workers, regarding safety management as a part of project management, and better project management, while the top five obstacles were putting safety as a lower priority due to cultural differences in organizations, workers' high turnover rates, tight project schedules, obstruction by sub-contractors, and inactive participation for the SMS implementation by the project team members. This study contributes to the current body of knowledge of safety research by examining the benefits of and obstacles to implementing SMS in the construction industry. The findings from this study are beneficial to the industry as well, because they can enhance the industry practitioners' understanding on SMS and help them to improve the implementation of SMS in their workplaces. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper synthetically analyzes and evaluates the merits and demerits of the traditional AHP, the Maximum Absolute Weighted Residual (MAWR), and the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), finally proposes a comprehensive weighting algorithm organically combining above methods. This algorithm applies to the weighting process under different evaluation matrix conditions. It neutralizes the excessive deviation caused by the human factors in the subjective weighting method and the data factors in the objective weighting method, so it makes the weighting result more reasonable. In addition, based on the comprehensive weighting algorithm, three kinds of typical railway signaling equipment are selected as calculation cases, and the weighting results can be applied in calculating the equipment dangerous failure rate, assessing the equipment safety level, and other risk management processes. This algorithm has practical application value for the risk assessment of the railway signaling system and its apparatus. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

It then examines how FCA has been used in bioinformatics applications, followed by future prospects of FCA in those areas. The applications addressed include gene data analysis (with next-generation sequencing), biomarkers discovery, protein-protein interaction, disease analysis (including COVID-19, cancer, and others), drug design and development, healthcare informatics, biomedical ontologies, and phylogeny. Some of the most promising prospects of FCA are: identifying influential nodes in a network representing protein-protein interactions, determining critical concepts to discover biomarkers, integrating machine learning and deep learning for cancer classification, and pattern matching for next-generation sequencing.},

Research has shown that a large majority of all incidents with drones is due not to technological, but to human error. An advanced risk-reduction methodology, focusing on the human element, is thus required in order to allow for the safe use of drones. In this paper, we therefore introduce a novel concept to provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the performance of the drone operator. The proposed methodology is based on one hand upon the development of standardized test methodologies and on the other hand on human performance modeling of the drone operators in a highly realistic simulation environment. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Human factors are the primary factors leading to accidents. Therefore, managing human factors is an important way to prevent accidents. This paper aims to introduce a new method to assess and manage human factors. First, the accident causation model was improved based on Reason's “Swiss-cheese” model, which was then combined with the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) to establish the human factors risk assessment model. The evaluation model includes 5 levels (organization influence, unsafe supervision, preconditions for unsafe acts, unsafe acts, and emergency influence) and 25 human factors. In the risk assessment process, the set pair analysis method was used to calculate the connection number and the partial connection number of each factor, level and whole system. The safety score and risk development interval were calculated by using the connection number, and the risk grade is determined. Thus, the dynamic quantitative evaluation of human risk is realized. By using the partial connection number, the risk development trend of each factor is predicted. Due to the lack of human managed enterprises, the safety status of people is approximately discrete. Therefore, this paper establishes the SPA–Markov chain risk prediction model to predict human risk. The verification results show that the prediction error is less than 2%. This indicates that the prediction model can be applied in practice. To reduce human risk, ABC analysis and the “S-O-R” model were used for human risk management. The application results show that this method has a significant effect on improving human safety factors. Finally, this paper summarizes 12 common unsafe factors and their effective safety “stimulus” measure, researching the accident path. According to the organizational level and individual level of human factors, different kinds of human factors management methods are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

abstract = {Emerging Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) technology have a ubiquitous communication framework. It poses security challenges in the form of cyber-attacks, prompting rigorous cybersecurity measures. There is a lack of knowledge on the anticipated cause-effect relationships and mechanisms of CAVs cybersecurity and the possible system behaviour, especially the unintended consequences. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD) model to analyse cybersecurity in the complex, uncertain deployment of CAVs. Specifically, the SD model integrates six critical avenues and maps their respective parameters that either trigger or mitigate cyber-attacks in the operation of CAVs using a systematic theoretical approach. These six avenues are: i) CAVs communication framework, ii) secured physical access, iii) human factors, iv) CAVs penetration, v) regulatory laws and policy framework, and iv) trust—across the CAVs-industry and among the public. Based on the conceptual model, various system archetypes are analysed. “Fixes that Fail”, in which the upsurge in hacker capability is the unintended natural result of technology maturity, requires continuous efforts to combat it. The primary mitigation steps are human behaviour analysis, knowledge of motivations and characteristics of CAVs cyber-attackers, CAVs users and Original Equipment Manufacturers education. “Shifting the burden”, where policymakers counter the perceived cyber threats of hackers by updating legislation that also reduces CAVs adaptation by imitations, indicated the need for calculated regulatory and policy intervention. The “limits to success” triggered by CAVs penetration increase the defended hacks to establish regulatory laws, improve trust, and develop more human analysis. However, it may also open up caveats for cyber-crimes and alert that CAVs deployment to be alignment with the intended goals for enhancing cybersecurity. The proposed model can support decision-making and training and stimulate the roadmap towards an optimized, self-regulating, and resilient cyber-safe CAV system. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We hypothesized that organizational factors (management involvement and harmonious relationships) within a relationship-oriented culture would influence supervisory work (ongoing monitoring and task instructions), the reporting system (selective reporting), and teamwork (team communication and co-ordination) in safety management at a group level, which would in turn influence individual reliance complacency, risk awareness, and practices.

abstract = {In recent decades, the shipping industry, described by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) [1] as "the most international of all the world's great industries and one of the most dangerous" (p. 401) has undergone significant change and momentous growth, improved training, and substantial regulatory oversight. Extensive risk management (RM) protocol notwithstanding, accidents still occur [2, 3], with 75% deriving from human factors [4, 5]. In a fundamentally people-based industry, RM and the Human Element, and therefore potential Human Error (HE), are intrinsically linked. Maritime RM is highly regulated with the ISM Code, MARPOL, SOLAS, and the IMO's Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) process all examples of the regulations and guidelines designed to proactively offset risk and prevent tragedy. Nevertheless, traditional maritime sector RM protocol relies heavily upon historical data which, in addition to the inherent undesirability of dependency, involves multiple other weaknesses. HE has been likened to a breakdown in technical reliability [7] where humans, in their susceptibility to inappropriate response in the face of disturbances to normal operations, act essentially as risk factors [6]. Recent perspectives on safety increasingly consider the Human Element as only one of a "network of errors" in a safety causation chain [7, p. 14]. In the Arctic, where unknowns are extensive and experience navigating them is not, this distinction is especially noteworthy. Strengthened and deeper connection with the Human Element, in conjunction with databank reinforcement and population, therefore appear fundamental to safety improvement efforts [6]. With particular focus on the Arctic, this paper explores whether Action Research is an appropriate methodology to (i) improve facilitation of tasks identified as necessary to mitigating the insufficiency of existing historical databases and (ii) contribute to safety improvement efforts and augment current RM protocol by bringing together the knowledge base of maritime stakeholders as representatives of the Human Element. {\textcopyright} 2017 Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy.

abstract = {Recent advances in machine intelligence and robotics have enabled new forms of human-computer interaction characterized by greater adaptability, shared decision-making, and mixed initiative. These advances are leading toward machines that can operate with relative autonomy but are designed to interact or engage with human counterparts in joint human-machine teams. The degree to which people trust machines is critical to the efficacy of these teams. People will cooperate with, and rely upon, intelligent agents they trust. Those they do not trust fall into disuse. As intelligent agents become more self-directed, learn from their experiences, and adapt behavior over time, the relationship between people and machines becomes more complex, and designing system behaviors to engender the proper level of trust becomes more challenging. Moreover, as intelligent systems become common in safety-critical domains, we must understand and assess the influence they might exert on human decision making to avoid unintended consequences, such as over-trust, compliance, or undue influence. Online social environments further complicate human-machine relationships. In the social media ecosystem, intelligent agents (e.g., chatbots) might act as aids or assistants but also as competitors or adversaries. In this context, research challenges include understanding how human-machine relationships evolve in social media and especially how humans develop trust and are susceptible to influence in social networks.

abstract = {The next generation of Internet services is driven by users and user-generated content. The complex nature of user behavior makes it highly challenging to manage and secure online services. On one hand, service providers cannot effectively prevent attackers from creating large numbers of fake identities to disseminate unwanted content (e.g., spam). On the other hand, abusive behavior from real users also poses significant threats (e.g., cyberbullying). In this article, we propose clickstream models to characterize user behavior in large online services. By analyzing clickstream traces (i.e., sequences of click events from users), we seek to achieve two goals: (1) detection: to capture distinct user groups for the detection ofmalicious accounts, and (2) understanding: to extract semantic information from user groups to understand the captured behavior. To achieve these goals, we build two related systems. The first one is a semisupervised system to detect malicious user accounts (Sybils). The core idea is to build a clickstream similarity graph where each node is a user and an edge captures the similarity of two users' clickstreams. Based on this graph, we propose a coloring scheme to identify groups of malicious accounts without relying on a large labeled dataset.We validate the system using groundtruth clickstream traces of 16,000 real and Sybil users from Renren, a large Chinese social network. The second system is an unsupervised system that aims to capture and understand the fine-grained user behavior. Instead of binary classification (malicious or benign), this model identifies the natural groups of user behavior and automatically extracts features to interpret their semantic meanings. Applying this system to Renren and another online social network,Whisper (100K users), we help service providers identify unexpected user behaviors and even predict users' future actions. Both systems received positive feedback from our industrial collaborators including Renren, LinkedIn, and Whisper after testing on their internal clickstream data.},

The conventional risk-based design concept is adopted to quantify ASIL, and fuzzy modeling is used to express the vehicle safety integrity ratings of uncertain automotive electrical equipment. To overcome the uncertainty, we fuzzify the variable using the mean expected value method and select the trapezoidal fuzzy number. The final fuzzy output is generated using Mamdani's method with 25 fuzzy rules combined with variables to obtain risk. This theory provides a useful approach for overcoming the inherent uncertainty in ASIL. We attempt to establish the effectiveness of the proposed method by utilizing it to quantify the automatic emergency-braking device scenario, which is a typical target system. {\textcopyright} 2020, KSAE.},

AREVA, one of the World's largest Nuclear Suppliers, has developed state-of-the-art capabilities in the development of DCS, either by using its own technology for safety-classified systems or third-party technologies for the nuclear plant operational I&C, as Engineering Procurement Construction contractor for New Build and significant existing plant upgrades and modernization projects. Its first experiences using simulation tools on real-life I&C projects having shown a factual improvement potential, AREVA acknowledged the interest of strengthening its DCS engineering processes by using simulation technology for early validation work and has identified the various tools characteristics that could be made available for that purpose. Leveraging the technology and competences of its subsidiary CORYS, co-owned with EDF, AREVA has worked on two axes, firstly defining and developing new tools using simulation, then by using them and assessing their added-value in particular regarding I&C functional validation. A tool suite was then developed, and will subsequently be improved along with its use within different projects. It starts with Plant Elementary system simulators, being used by System Engineers performing system tests to validate design of the system they are in charge of. Then, through their combination into an overall plant system simulator, I&C functions performance throughout their different interfaces can be checked, as well as the implemented interlocks and alarm annunciation. It comes finally to a comprehensive plant engineering simulator that can be used for different purposes such as the validation of plant or commissioning procedures, support to Human Factor engineering activities, as well as the early validation of I&C interfaces between Plant Elementary systems.

There are significant advancements in the threat space that have led towards an essential need for the strengthening of digital infrastructure security. Better security can be achieved by fine-Tuning system parameters to the best and optimized security levels. For the protection of infrastructure and information systems, several guidelines have been provided by well-known organizations in the form of cybersecurity standards. Since security vulnerabilities incur a very high degree of financial, reputational, informational, and organizational security compromise, it is imperative that a baseline for standard compliance be established. The selection of security standards and extracting requirements from those standards in an organizational context is a tedious task. This article presents a detailed literature review, a comprehensive analysis of various cybersecurity standards, and statistics of cyber-Attacks related to operating systems (OS). In addition to that, an explicit comparison between the frameworks, tools, and software available for OS compliance testing is provided. An in-depth analysis of the most common software solutions ensuring compliance with certain cybersecurity standards is also presented. Finally, based on the cybersecurity standards under consideration, a comprehensive set of minimum requirements is proposed for OS hardening and a few open research challenges are discussed.},

abstract = {In the petroleum industry, the study and impact of human reliability on safe and efficient operations is receiving heightened awareness. According to recent studies, human errors contributed to an estimated 60 to 90 percent of all accidents across many industries (petroleum, nuclear and aviation industries, etc.). Human errors can result in two possible outcomes of concern: safety risks and the cost of failure. In operations where the consequences of accidents may be unbearable, the emphasis on safety drives the study and research of human reliability. This effort has led to a number of human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, and they provide useful references for managing human errors. This paper examines how the petroleum industry could utilize and benefit from the available HRA methods by applying them to daily operations. Several HRA methods are reviewed in this paper from three aspects: human error identification, human error prediction of given tasks, and factors that contribute to human errors. A good data collection system can substantially support the HRA study qualitatively and quantitatively. This paper also introduces a practice for human error data collection that was implemented in the nuclear industry-human event repository analysis (HERA). Suggestions and remarks are provided about developing similar human error data collection systems tailored for the petroleum industry. The expected benefits of HRA include a better understanding of the causes and influencing factors of human errors in specific operation conditions, and insights into error-reduction measures for reducing accident risk and the cost of product failure.

abstract = {Straighteners are commonly used in the field of plate straightening. With the shortage of industrial land, an increasing number of straightener manufacturers integrate uncoilers, straighteners, and feeders, which represent a three-in-one machine tool. The tool's functions are complex; many factors affect its reliability and performance, including the problems of equipment itself and human errors. To improve the reliability of this machine, it is necessary to identify the main failure modes and causes. The risk assessment of using the conventional failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) presents several issues. Thus, multiple methods have been proposed to improve the robustness and applicability of the FMEA. Herein, an improved FMEA, which combines fuzzy set and entropy evaluations is utilized to assess the three-in-one machine tool. In the method, the fuzzy set method is used to quantify the evaluation index. The information entropy and expert evaluation method are used to determine the weight between the indexes. From this study, human operation errors accounted for over 55% of the risks of machine malfunctions. By evaluating failure modes, a few countermeasures to reduce human operation errors can be proposed. By improving the human machine interface design and ergonomic job design and providing adequate training, human errors can be reduced and the reliability of three-in-one machine tools can be improved. {\textcopyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Autonomous driving systems (ADS) in recent years have been the subject of focus, evolving as one of the major mobility disruptors and being a potential candidate for deployment in urban cities due to urbanization. ADS is the system within the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) that enables automation. The different ADS technologies that enable autonomous vehicles have reached a certain maturity that no longer focus on technological deployment, but rather on the safe deployment on public roads. However, existing standards that validate functional safety and Risk Assessment (RA) may not be sufficient to tackle the increased complexity of ADS compared to traditional vehicles. This demand in ADS safety is exponentially increasing in tandem with the increase of AV automation levels. ADS are exposed to diverse environmental conditions and therefore subjected to operational risks while attempting to mimic the human driver responses. Moreover, the recent use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the industry further shapes the way how ADS development will become in the future. This paper explains the importance of RA coverage for AV and provides a comparison and summary of existing RA methodologies. Thereafter, a recommendation of RAs for AV as potential solutions in meeting ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 21448 standards. IEEE},

abstract = {For the elderly, walking is an important, reliable mobility option, since the elderly frequently lose their physical and/or sensory ability to drive as their age increases. However, elderly pedestrians are vulnerable on the streets and are at great risk of injury or death, when involved in a collision. This is due to not only increased frailty but also such issues as reaction speed and confidence on the streets. Therefore, pedestrian safety for older adults is a growing concern. This paper comprehensively examines the relationship between physical conditions and elderly pedestrian safety at the intersection level. By constructing a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model, this paper identifies the exclusive contributing factors to elderly pedestrian collisions rather than younger pedestrian collisions. The outputs from the model suggest that facilities such as raised median, three-way intersection, street tree, and park and recreational land use improve the safety of elderly pedestrians. They also imply that bus stops increase elderly pedestrian collisions, while the intersections with crosswalks or colored crosswalks do not contribute to elderly pedestrians' safety, but the safety of younger pedestrians. The findings of this paper provide insight to transportation policies like Complete Street and Vision Zero and help to improve the current road system that are designed for automobiles and young, healthy road users. {\textcopyright} 2019},

abstract = {The paper is focusing on road tunnel safety and builds upon the Directive 2004/54/EC launched by the European Commission; the latter sets basic requirements and suggests the implementation of risk assessment in several tunnel cases apart from technical measures imposed on the basis of tunnel structural and operational characteristics. Since the EU Directive does not indicate the method for performing risk assessment, a wide range of methods have been proposed, most of them based on quantitative risk assessment (QRA). Although the majority of current road tunnel QRAs assess physical aspects of the tunnel system and consider several hazards concerning the transportation of dangerous goods through a tunnel, they do not take into account, sufficiently, several organizational and human-related factors that can greatly affect the overall safety level of these critical infrastructures. To cope with this limitation this paper proposes a fuzzy logic system based on CREAM method for human reliability analysis (Hollnagel, 1998) in order to provide more sophisticated estimations of the tunnel operator's performance in safety critical situations. It is deduced that a human reliability analysis component to analyze operator performance, like the fuzzy system proposed here, is important for risk analysts. Consideration of organizational and human factors will enhance risk analysts' studies and highlight the uncertainty related to human performance variability. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

abstract = {Whether acting as controls in their own right, being relied on to ensure physical, hardware or electronic controls are in place and functional when needed, or as a threat to safe operations, human performance is central to the development, implementation and sustainable operation of barrier management systems. Many organisations however struggle to know how to ensure: (a) that the human performance they rely on can reasonably be expected to happen when and where it is needed; and, (b) that the controls they intend to have in place are as robust as they reasonably can be to the loss of human reliability. Drawing on real-world incidents, this paper examines some of the expectations that are widely held about human performance in barrier management systems. Those expectations are considered in the light of the reality behind how people think, behave and perform in real world tasks: what are referred to as “hard truths” of human performance. Drawing largely on the technique of Bowtie analysis, weaknesses in the way human factors are treated in current approaches to barrier management are reviewed, and improvements suggested. The paper illustrates how most human and organisational controls should be treated as safeguards rather than full barriers: they are critical to safety management, but are rarely able to meet the criteria necessary to be treated as full barriers. The equivalence of a Human Performance Standard to an Equipment Performance Standard is illustrated with a practical example. {\textcopyright} 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers},

One of the most prominent users of automation is the people that are working in the healthcare sector. There are a lot of benefits from healthcare automation applications. One of them is by reducing error rates as illustrated by Felder (2003), virus infected patients 29 times (approx.) for every million transfusions, healthcare automation can mitigate this. Alongside the exponential growth of automation, some adjustments are required, thus, the role of human factors is very important to adjust changes and get the most value of the human-automation system. This paper demonstrates a systematic literature review of scientific papers on human factors in healthcare automation usage. To further understand this relationship several analyses were done by using the keywords “healthcare”, “automation”, and “human factors” and extracting those keywords from articles to see trends. The analyses were conducted using VOSViewer, Harzing's Publish or Perish, AuthorMapper, and MAXQDA to obtain emerging keywords (co-occurrence), co-author analysis, and co-citation analysis.

Overall, communication and other non-technical skills were rated as being very important for all cyber defense jobs. Findings indicated that, for some specialty areas, technical knowledge and skills vary considerably between jobs and so the ability to teach oneself is more valuable than proficiency in any one KSA.

The organizations' ability to adapt immediately meant their survival and even in some cases a positive evolution of their business. The digital transformation applied in an abrupt way has uncovered some critical factors for its success. One of the most relevant factors will be information security. Many of the digital systems put into operation more intensively during the pandemic, have shown to be highly fragile on issues related to information security. One relevant problem of the organizations is the low effectiveness and efficiency of financial, human, and material resources, allocated to the reduction or mitigation of the risks identified in their information systems.

abstract = {A thorough understanding of the safety risks of a system requires an understanding of its human and organizational factors, as well as its technical components. Analysis approaches that focus only on the latter without considering, for example, how human decision makers may respond to a technical failure, are not able to adequately capture the wide variety of safety risk scenarios that need to be considered. In this paper, we propose a model-based analysis approach that allows analysts to interpret humans and organizations in terms of components and their behavior in terms of failure logic. Our approach builds on top of CHESS-FLA, which is a tool-supported failure logic analysis technique that supports analysis of component-based system architectures to understand what can go wrong at the system level and to identify the causes (i.e. Faulty components). However, CHESS-FLA currently deals only with hardware and software components and thus it is not adequate to reason about socio-technical systems. We therefore provide an extension based on a pre-existing classification of socio-failures and combine it with the one used in CHESS-FLA for technical failures, thereby giving birth to a novel approach to analysis of socio-technical systems. We demonstrate our approach on an example from the petroleum domain. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {Oxygen has been a significant variable in flight operations for nearly 60 years. Today, the use of oxygen is almost synonymous with rocket, jet and turbo-prop operations affecting more than 45,000 aircraft worldwide. Today's pilot flies farther, higher and longer than ever before, and does so at an ever increasing frequency. While the past 60 years have yielded tremendous advances in propulsion, avionics, materials and many other areas, oxygen and its role in aviation has remained largely stagnant. Although considered a major aircraft system and an essential component in high altitude operations, the orthodox mantra of 'engineering it better' has produced only limited results, most of them in the area of dispensation equipment (masks). In recent years Aeronautical Data Systems and collaborative entities have begun working to create a standardized and comprehensive aviation oxygen safety management system. This paper includes a general examination of what a new aviation oxygen doctrine would entail, how it would diverge from existing industry policies, and how it would improve industry safety. This analysis is derived from work produced in an earlier collaboration with the University of North Dakota Aerospace Foundation. This study was initially created in an attempt to improve the oxygen safety training offered to its aeronautics/human factors students. This document is an evolution of the initial study intended to create discussion among industry leaders and specialists in order to generate broader feedback and consensus regarding aviation oxygen safety. The ultimate objective of this paper is to lead into a final and standardized method of implementing an Oxygen SMS Module. This paper diverges from traditional thinking in that it applies an information and skill based solution to a system that has otherwise been viewed as a hardware problem. To put it simply: Aircraft oxygen systems have possessed the capacity for substantial operational flexibility for a very long time. What has been absent is the ability to synthesize oxygen data into a legible format and the education to utilize this information to its greatest effect. Over the past decade advances in software, electronics, telecommunications and physiological research have provided the components necessary for a true modernization of aviation oxygen. We assert that these advances can collectively yield a new system of oxygen safety that delivers to aviators an unprecedented level of capability in planning for, reacting to, and surviving an oxygen contingency. {\textcopyright} 2018 SAE International.

Every engineer knows well and always considers about “The local optimization would make the entire worst of the system”, and therefore understands importance of the system safety concept that well balanced design and operation are required. At present, the existing huge complex systems have been reduced in hardware risk through hardware countermeasures and quality assurance activities based on safety logic, so the remaining risk can be said to be events involving human factors. For this reason, risk reduction activities can be described as human performance improvement activities. Risk informed decision-making can be said a decision-making framework that improves human performance, based on the probabilistic risk assessment results. Furthermore, continuing this activity will eventually lead to the maintenance and improvement of the safety culture. In other words, what we want to emphasize here is that “system safety”, “risk reduction activities”, “human performance improvement activities”, “risk informed decision-making”, and “maintenance and improvement of safety culture” have similar purposes and contents. {\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical Systems of Systems (SoSs) are large-scale systems made of independent and autonomous cyber-physical Constituent Systems (CSs) which may interoperate to achieve high-level goals also with the intervention of humans. Providing security in such SoSs means, among other features, forecasting and anticipating evolving SoS functionalities, ultimately identifying possible detrimental phenomena that may result from the interactions of CSs and humans. Such phenomena, usually called emergent phenomena, are often complex and difficult to capture: the first appearance of an emergent phenomenon in a cyber-physical SoS is often a surprise to the observers. Adequate support to understand emergent phenomena will assist in reducing both the likelihood of design or operational flaws, and the time needed to analyze the relations amongst the CSs, which always has a key economic significance. This article presents a threat analysis methodology and a supporting tool aimed at (i) identifying (emerging) threats in evolving SoSs, (ii) reducing the cognitive load required to understand an SoS and the relations among CSs, and (iii) facilitating SoS risk management by proposing mitigation strategies for SoS administrators. The proposed methodology, as well as the tool, is empirically validated on Smart Grid case studies by submitting questionnaires to a user base composed of 3 stakeholders and 18 BSc and MSc students.},

Using Symantec's WINE platform, we conduct a detailed study of 1.6 million machines over an 8-month period in order to learn the relationship between user behavior and cyber attacks against their personal computers. We classify users into 4 categories (gamers, professionals, software developers, and others, plus a fifth category comprising everyone) and identify a total of 7 features that act as proxies for human behavior. For each of the 35 possible combinations (5 categories times 7 features), we studied the relationship between each of these seven features and one dependent variable, namely the number of attempted malware attacks detected by Symantec on the machine. Our results show that there is a strong relationship between several features and the number of attempted malware attacks. Had these hosts not been protected by Symantec's anti-virus product or a similar product, they would likely have been infected. Surprisingly, our results show that software developers are more at risk of engaging in risky cyber-behavior than other categories.},

One of possibilities is the System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) using a hierarchical safety control structure for finding control flaws leading to hazards. The aim of this paper is to enhance STAMP error taxonomy by Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). The method proposed in this paper is STAMP-HFACS framework for accident analysis. This framework is STAMP structure-driven, i.e. levels of the HFACS structure are incorporated into components of the STAMP safety control structure. A result of the proposed procedure is the STAMP-HFACS diagram. To illustrate the applicability of the method one thread of the {\"{U}}berlingen midair accident was analyzed. The STAMP-HFACS methodology can express interactions between people, technical equipment, and the environment. It is not bound to an incident/accident events chain. It allows for an analysis of a safety-related occurrence focused on finding some adverse relationships between the components, especially at higher levels of the HFACS methodology. Proper recognition of these relationships, and especially their interpretation in system-theoretic terms related to specific components, can be of great importance for increasing the level of air traffic safety. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Problem: Safety management programs (SMPs) are designed to mitigate risk of workplace injuries and create a safe working climate. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the relationship between contractors' SMPs and workers' perceived safety climate and safety behaviors among small and medium-sized construction subcontractors. Methods: Subcontractor SMP scores on 18 organizational and project-level safety items were coded from subcontractors' written safety programs and interviews. Workers completed surveys to report perceptions of their contractor's safety climate and the safety behaviors of coworkers, crews, and themselves. The associations between SMP scores and safety climate and behavior scales were examined using Spearman correlation and hierarchical linear regression models (HLM). Results: Among 78 subcontractors working on large commercial construction projects, we found striking differences in SMP scores between small, medium, and large subcontractors (p < 0.001), related to a number of specific safety management practices. We observed only weak relationships between SMP scales and safety climate scores reported by 746 workers of these subcontractors ($\beta$ = 0.09, p = 0.04 by HLM). We saw no differences in worker reported safety climate and safety behaviors by contractor size. Discussion: SMP only weakly predicted safety climate scales of subcontractors, yet there were large differences in the quality and content of SMPs by size of employers. Summary: Future work should determine the best way to measure safety performance of construction companies and determine the factors that can lead to improved safety performance of construction firms. Practical applications: Our simple assessment of common elements of safety management programs used document review and interviews with knowledgeable representatives. These methods identified specific safety management practices that differed between large and small employers. In order to improve construction safety, it is important to understand how best to measure safety performance in construction companies to gain knowledge for creating safer work environments. {\textcopyright} 2020},

If a fault or an unexpected deviation from the mission plan should occur, which the autonomous capability of the AUV does not discover as a fault, the operators have to detect these instead and act appropriately. This paper presents a Bayesian Belief Network to assess the probability of monitoring success of an AUV mission. Some of the influences that are incorporated in the model are; Trust in the System, Automation Etiquette, Additional Workload, Time Delay and Loss of Status Messages. It is believed that the model can help improve AUV operations by clarifying relationships between technical, human and organizational factors and their influence on mission risk. {\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {This study examined the impact of use of a computer software application designed specifically for older people known as PRISM-a Personal Reminder Information and Social Management system-which was installed on a computer that was placed in the homes of adults aged 65 to 98 years, who were at risk for social isolation and had minimal or no computer skills and no computers in their homes. Participants received face-to-face training on the system in their homes over several days and a variety of measures were collected at baseline and at 12 months. A growth mixture model applied to participants' usage of the system over the course of 12 months revealed two distinct subpopulations of users-less-frequent users and more-frequent users- who after one year of exposure to the system differed in computer proficiency, attitudes toward computers, and ratings of system usability. These two groups did not differ on computer proficiency and computer attitude measures at baseline. The more-frequent user group, however, had significantly higher fluid cognitive abilities. Additional analytical models were used to further examine the relationships among the study measures. The implications of the findings are discussed in terms of the importance of usability for promoting initial engagement with a system and that increased engagement with the system can instill beliefs in these older adults that they can successfully transition to other computer-based technologies and applications. The results also underscore the importance of the user-centered design approach and designing highly usable systems for older adults with low technology proficiency.},

abstract = {The frequency of occurrence of an accident is a key aspect in the risk assessment field. Variables such as the human factor (HF), which is a major cause of undesired events in process industries, are usually not considered explicitly, mainly due to the uncertainty generated due to the lack of knowledge and the complexity associated to it. In this work, failure frequencies are modified through Monte Carlo (MC) simulation including the uncertainty generated by HF. MC is one of the most commonly approach used for uncertainty assessment based on probability distribution functions that represent all the variables included in the model. This technique has been also proved to be very useful in the risk assessment field. The model takes into account the uncertainty and variability generated by several HF variables. In order to test the model, it has been applied to two real case studies, obtaining new frequency values for the different scenarios. Together with the consequences assessment, new isorisk curves were plotted. Since the uncertainty generated by the HF has now been taken in to account through MC simulation, these new values are more realistic and accurate. As a result, an improvement of the final risk assessment is achieved. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

This paper analyzes the multiple risk factors of an aging jacket platform in Bohai Bay, China and builds the safety evaluation index system, which includes three levels, namely, the target layer, the first-grade indicators layer and the second-grade indicators layer. The target layer consists of three first-grade indicators: ocean environments, structure status, and human and organizational factors. Each first-grade indicator is divided into three second-grade indicators. The weight of each indicator is calculated by analytic hierarchy process method to weaken subjective effect. Grey clustering method is applied to estimate the failure risk of the platform in Bohai Bay qualitatively and quantitatively. The assessment standard is divided into five grades and the whitening function of each grey cluster is determined by the assessment scheme. The grey evaluation weight vector of each second-grade indicator is calculated by the table dispatching method. Through layer by layer calculation, the grey assessment value of the target layer is finally estimated by making the grey assessment weight vector single-value and the grey grade is determined according to the maximum principle. The evaluation results show quantitatively that the failure risk grade of the jacket platform in Bohai Bay is medium and the safety assessment method is reasonable and feasible. {\textcopyright} 2017, Editorial Board of Journal of Ship Mechanics.

abstract = {The increasing level of automation and complexity in the automotive industry has led to the establishment of a work environment, where human machine interface and human reliability are becoming critical factors of performance especially for safety critical tasks. Many different methodologies for performing risk assessment considering human factors are already available in the literature, but they were often developed for domains other than the automotive industry (aviation, nuclear and process industry). Their purpose is to support the root cause evaluation and estimate the probability of faulty human actions. The present paper introduces a method to support the evaluation and the choice of a suitable Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) technique for the automotive sector considering the ones proposed from other industrial domains. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) provides a way of assisting safety managers and risk assessors in the HRA technique selection process. This allows the selected HRA techniques to be evaluated based on relevant criteria for an application in an automotive manufacturing environment. An example of selected HRA techniques in this paper will be demonstrated in a case study. The example can also suggest implications to improve existing industry guidelines, international standards and regulations, which are frequently calling for a wide range of ergonomic factors to be considered in the risk assessment process. Further the case study should show potential benefits to organizations coming from the selection and application of the right HRA technique. {\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Single-vehicle crashes contribute to more fatalities compared to other crash types in the United States. Based on the age group, risk factors associated with single-vehicle fatal crashes were compared between older drivers and other drivers who have been involved in crashes at intersections in the Midwest region. In this study, a fatal crash data set was gathered for five years from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database. Two separate logistic regression models were developed to predict single-vehicle fatal crashes at intersections by older and other drivers. Risk factors affecting toward increased single-vehicle fatal crashes at intersections were identified for each age group, and comparisons were made with the intention of identifying suitable countermeasures. The effect of these factors was more strongly influential toward increased older driver fatal single-vehicle crashes at intersections compared to other drivers. The predictors that increase fatal single-vehicle crashes at intersections for both driver age groups were controlled intersections, two-way undivided highways, reduced speed limits, urban roadway locations, driving during nighttime, and rollover or hitting animals. Additionally, driving under influence of alcohol or drugs were determinants of elevated fatal single-vehicle crashes at intersections for other drivers but not for older drivers. The study findings are helpful in investigating the potential ways in improving the safety of not only older drivers, but also all road users.  {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

The development of online education systems such as e-learning and e-assessment provide many advantages to the users especially the flexibility in teaching and learning. The online education system has the capability to improve the quality of delivery education. However, security risks have been the major weakness in the acceptance of technology in education field which limits the user acceptance of the online education system. Even though there are other studies providing solutions for identified security threats in online education usage, there is no particular model which addresses the factors that influences the acceptance of e-assessment system by lecturers from security perspective. The aim of this study is to explore security aspects of e-assessment in regard to the acceptance of technology by lecturers. A conceptual model of secure acceptance of e-assessment is proposed considering both human and perceived security aspects. The data for this study was collected through online survey and paper-based survey. The conceptual model is analyzed using multiple regressions to identify the predictive power between dependent variable and independent variable. The final result of this study demonstrates how security factors influence lecturers' attitudes towards the acceptance of e-assessment from security perspective with a strong significant contribution to the e-assessment acceptance by lecturers. This study will be useful in providing more insightful understanding regarding the factors that influence the lecturers' acceptance of e-assessment system from security perspective.},

The objective of the research was to observe in a naturalistic setting the kinds of interpersonal and wireless communication losses experienced by first responders during emergency responses, and to determine both their causes and their effects on human performance and safety. Assessment of the cognitive and physical workload of first responders indicated moderate levels of workload and perceived temporal stress. Although tactical team leaders naturally experience increased workload due to the nature of their roles, radio communications loss did not significantly impact that load. However, it was noted that despite the safety detriments, first responders continued with mission tasks without ensuring an acceptable level of radio communication with cohorts. Recommendations were made to mitigate communications loss, minimize risk, enhance safety, and ensure first responders maintain situation awareness. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

Many pilot error analysis methods currently exist, but rarely focus on the design-induced pilot error. This paper develops a new pilot error analysis method (PEAM) specially for the investigation and analysis of design-induced pilot error on the flight decks. PEAM is established on the basis of three existing techniques (HMIP - Human Model of Information Processing; SRK - Skill based error, Rule based error, Knowledge based error; and CREAM - Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method). It is applied to analyze 122 design-induced commercial aviation incidents that occurred from January 2004 to December 2010, which are attained from Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). The results demonstrated that PEAM could reliably accommodate all design-induced pilot error associated with the incidents we examined, and accurately identify and sort the devices of aircraft cockpit human-machine interface related to pilot error. These results will help to determine the flaws of specific devices on the flight decks, prevent the pilot error from a designed perspective, and provide specific concerns to transport aircraft human factors airworthiness certification.},

abstract = {Recommender systems increasingly use contextual and demographical data as a basis for recommendations. Users, however, often feel uncomfortable providing such information. In a privacy-minded design of recommenders, users are free to decide for themselves what data they want to disclose about themselves. But this decision is often complex and burdensome, because the consequences of disclosing personal information are uncertain or even unknown. Although a number of researchers have tried to analyze and facilitate such information disclosure decisions, their research results are fragmented, and they often do not hold up well across studies. This article describes a unified approach to privacy decision research that describes the cognitive processes involved in users' "privacy calculus" in terms of system-related perceptions and experiences that act as mediating factors to information disclosure. The approach is applied in an online experiment with 493 participants using a mock-up of a context-aware recommender system. Analyzing the results with a structural linear model, we demonstrate that personal privacy concerns and disclosure justification messages affect the perception of and experience with a system, which in turn drive information disclosure decisions. Overall, disclosure justification messages do not increase disclosure. Although they are perceived to be valuable, they decrease users' trust and satisfaction. Another result is that manipulating the order of the requests increases the disclosure of items requested early but decreases the disclosure of items requested later. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {The functional safety research for automotive cyber-physical systems (ACPS) has been studied in recent years; however, these studies merely consider the change in the exposure of the functional safety classification and assume that the driver's controllability in the functional safety classification is always fixed and uncontrollable. In fact, the driver's controllability is variable during the runtime phase, such that the execution process of safety-critical automotive functions is a human-interaction-aware process between the driver and ACPS. To adapt to the changes in the driver's controllability, this article studies the human-interaction-aware adaptive functional safety processing for multi-functional ACPS in two main phases. In the design phase, where the driver's controllability is fixed at the highest level (i.e., C3), we obtain the approximate optimal priority sequence of safety-critical functions without exhausting all sequences by proposing the refined exploration method. In the runtime phase, where the driver's controllability level is variable (i.e., C0, C1, C2, or C3), we propose the human-interaction-aware task remapping method to autonomously respond to the change of the driver's controllability. Examples and experiments confirm that the proposed adaptive functional safety processing can reduce overall task redundancy of safety-critical automotive functions while meeting their functional safety requirements, shorten the overall response time of safety-critical automotive functions, and increase the slack time for non-safety-critical automotive functions.},

abstract = {During a review of the Advanced Test Reactor safety basis at the Idaho National Laboratory, human factors engineers identified ergonomic and human reliability risks involving the inadvertent exposure of a fuel element to the air during manual fuel movement and inspection in the canal. There were clear indications that these risks increased the probability of human error and possible severe physical outcomes to the operator. In response to this concern, a detailed study was conducted to determine the probability of the inadvertent exposure of a fuel element. Due to practical and safety constraints, the task network analysis technique was employed to study the work procedures at the canal. Discrete-event simulation software was used to model the entire procedure as well as the salient physical attributes of the task environment, such as distances walked, the effect of dropped tools, the effect of hazardous body postures, and physical exertion due to strenuous tool handling. The model also allowed analysis of the effect of cognitive processes such as visual perception demands, auditory information and verbal communication. The model made it possible to obtain reliable predictions of operator performance and workload estimates. It was also found that operator workload as well as the probability of human error in the fuel inspection and transfer task were influenced by the concurrent nature of certain phases of the task and the associated demand on cognitive and physical resources. More importantly, it was possible to determine with reasonable accuracy the stages as well as physical locations in the fuel handling task where operators would be most at risk of losing their balance and falling into the canal. The model also provided sufficient information for a human reliability analysis that indicated that the postulated fuel exposure accident was less than credible.},

In this paper, we consider a set of practical safety challenges related to applying advanced AI to autonomous machine systems and present solutions from the perspective of human factors. We apply the novel concept of AI awareness (AIA) to discuss the challenges in detail, and based on this, provide suggestions and guidelines for mitigating the AI safety risks with autonomous systems. In addition, we briefly consider the system design process to identify the actions that should be taken to ensure AIA throughout the different systems engineering design phases. The theoretical research presented in this paper aims to provide the first steps towards considering AIA in autonomous systems and understanding the human factors perspective viewpoint on AI safety for autonomous systems. {\textcopyright} Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract = {Safety has been a primary concern in every industry. It includes system, personnel, environmental safety, etc. Maritime transportation safety is of the utmost importance because a lot of economic and environmental damage has been caused by ship‐related accidents. The majority of these accidents have resulted from human factors. For the analysis of accidents and future safety, various accident models have been created. In this study, human‐based errors are analyzed and quantified by using the fuzzy fault tree analysis, which helps calculate the failure probability of the causes. A real‐life case of a chemical tanker Key Bora was studied and analyzed, which happened on 28 March 2020, at Kyleakin Pier, Isle of Skye, Scotland. The ship's hull was seriously damaged and was flooded. According to the analysis, two main human factors that contributed the most to the occurrence of this accident were found. These incidents can be avoided by ensuring proper measures are followed, and the results can be used as guidelines for future marine accident investi-gations and safety. {\textcopyright} 2022 by the authors.

abstract = {Personal data is increasingly collected and used by companies to tailor services to users, and to make financial, employment, and health-related decisions about individuals. When personal data is inappropriately collected or misused, however, individuals may experience violations of their privacy. Historically, government regulators have relied on the concept of risk in energy, aviation and medicine, among other domains, to determine the extent to which products and services may harm the public. To address privacy concerns in government-controlled information technology, government agencies are advocating to adapt similar risk management frameworks to privacy. Despite the recent shift toward a risk-managed approach for privacy, to our knowledge, there are no empirical methods to determine which personal data are most at-risk and which contextual factors increase or decrease that risk. To this end, we introduce an empirical framework in this article that consists of factorial vignette surveys that can be used to measure the effect of different factors and their levels on privacy risk. We report a series of experiments to measure perceived privacy risk using the proposed framework, which are based on expressed preferences, and which we define as an individual's willingness to share their personal data with others given the likelihood of a potential privacy harm. These experiments control for one or more of the six factors affecting an individual's willingness to share their information: data type, computer type, data purpose, privacy harm, harm likelihood, and individual demographic factors, such as age range, gender, education level, ethnicity, and household income. To measure likelihood, we introduce and evaluate a new likelihood scale based on construal level theory in psychology. The scale frames individual attitudes about risk likelihood based on social and physical distance to the privacy harm. The findings include predictions about the extent to which the above factors correspond to risk acceptance, including that perceived risk is lower for induced disclosure harms when compared to surveillance and insecurity harms as defined in Solove's Taxonomy of Privacy. We also found that participants are more willing to share their information when they perceive the benefits of sharing. In addition, we found that likelihood was not a multiplicative factor in computing privacy risk perception, which challenges conventional theories of privacy risk in the privacy and security community.},

abstract = {In cyberspace, various types of social engineering attacks have made humans in a system more vulnerable than ever. One of the popular social engineering attacks is a phishing attack, exploiting humans' vulnerability in order to obtain individuals' private or credential information. Recent studies have found that the so called 'phishing susceptibility' (i.e., the likelihood of being phished) is closely correlated with the individuals' personality traits. In particular, the relations between phishing susceptibility and Big Five personality traits have been analyzed via empirical studies in diverse domains. However, little prior work has proposed a mathematical model investigating the effect of an individual's personality traits on perceived trust or risk and decision performance. This work proposes a probability model using Stochastic Petri Nets in order to examine the effect of an individual human's personality traits on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance. Our results show that agreeableness and neuroticism have significant effect on perceived trust and risk, and decision performance particularly when openness and conscientiousness is very low. The developed mathematical model can be applied to predict what personality profiles in an organization are more exposed to social engineering, suggesting customized security training scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Privacy behaviors of individuals are often inconsistent with their stated attitudes, a phenomenon known as the "privacy paradox." These inconsistencies may lead to troublesome or regrettable experiences. To help people address these privacy inconsistencies, we propose a personalized privacy notification approach that juxtaposes users' general privacy attitudes towards specific technologies and the potential privacy riskiness of particular instances of such technology, right when users make decisions about whether and/or how to use the technology under consideration. Highlighting the privacy inconsistencies to users was designed to nudge them in making decisions in a way that aligns with their privacy attitudes.To illustrate this approach, we chose the domain of mobile apps and designed a privacy discrepancy interface that highlights this discrepancy between users' general privacy attitudes towards mobile apps and the potential privacy riskiness of a particular app, nudging them to make app installation and/or permission granting decisions reflecting their privacy attitudes. To evaluate this interface, we conducted an online experiment simulating the process of installing Android apps. We compared the privacy discrepancy approach with several existing privacy notification approaches. Our results suggest that the behaviors of participants who used the privacy discrepancy interface better reflected their privacy attitudes than the other approaches.},

abstract = {A major challenge for autonomous vehicles is interacting with other traffic participants safely and smoothly. A promising approach to handle such traffic interactions is equipping autonomous vehicles with interaction-aware controllers (IACs). These controllers predict how surrounding human drivers will respond to the autonomous vehicle's actions, based on a driver model. However, the predictive validity of driver models used in IACs is rarely validated, which can limit the interactive capabilities of IACs outside the simple simulated environments in which they are demonstrated. In this article, we argue that besides evaluating the interactive capabilities of IACs, their underlying driver models should be validated on natural human driving behavior. We propose a workflow for this validation that includes scenario-based data extraction and a two-stage (tactical/operational) evaluation procedure based on human factors literature. We demonstrate this workflow in a case study on an inverse-reinforcement-learning-based driver model replicated from an existing IAC. This model only showed the correct tactical behavior in 40% of the predictions. The model's operational behavior was inconsistent with observed human behavior. The case study illustrates that a principled evaluation workflow is useful and needed. We believe that our workflow will support the development of appropriate driver models for future automated vehicles.},

abstract = {Cyberbullying is a growing problem across social media platforms, inflicting short and long-lasting effects on victims. To mitigate this problem, research has looked into building automated systems, powered by machine learning, to detect cyberbullying incidents, or the involved actors like victims and perpetrators. In the past, systematic reviews have examined the approaches within this growing body of work, but with a focus on the computational aspects of the technical innovation, feature engineering, or performance optimization, without centering around the roles, beliefs, desires, or expectations of humans. In this paper, we present a human-centered systematic literature review of the past 10 years of research on automated cyberbullying detection. We analyzed 56 papers based on a three-prong human-centeredness algorithm design framework - spanning theoretical, participatory, and speculative design. We found that the past literature fell short of incorporating human-centeredness across multiple aspects, ranging from defining cyberbullying, establishing the ground truth in data annotation, evaluating the performance of the detection models, to speculating the usage and users of the models, including potential harms and negative consequences. Given the sensitivities of the cyberbullying experience and the deep ramifications cyberbullying incidents bear on the involved actors, we discuss takeaways on how incorporating human-centeredness in future research can aid with developing detection systems that are more practical, useful, and tuned to the diverse needs and contexts of the stakeholders.},

Simply put, modern spyware steals the basic information needed to fuel more deadly attacks such as ransomware and banking fraud. Not surprisingly, some forms of spyware are also classified as banking trojans (e.g., ACECARD). We present a data-driven characterization of the principal factors that distinguish modern Android spyware (July 2016-July 2017) both from goodware and other Android malware, using both traditional and deep ML. First, we propose an Ensemble Late Fusion (ELF) architecture that combines the results of multiple classifiers' predicted probabilities to generate a final prediction. We show that ELF outperforms several of the best-known traditional and deep learning classifiers. Second, we automatically identify key features that distinguish spyware both from goodware and from other malware. Finally we present a detailed analysis of the factors distinguishing five important families of Android spyware: UAPUSH, PINCER, HEHE, USBCLEAVER, and ACECARD (the last is a hybrid spyware-banking trojan).},

Millions of malicious URLs are used as distribution channels to propagate malware all over theWeb. After being infected, victim systems fall in the control of attackers, who can utilize them for various cyber crimes such as stealing credentials, spamming, and distributed denial-ofservice attacks. Moreover, it has been observed that traditional security technologies such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems have only limited capability to mitigate this new problem. In this article, we survey the state-of-the-art research regarding the analysis of-and defense against-Web-based malware attacks. First, we study the attack model, the root cause, and the vulnerabilities that enable these attacks. Second, we analyze the status quo of the Web-based malware problem. Third, three categories of defense mechanisms are discussed in detail: (1) building honeypots with virtual machines or signature-based detection system to discover existing threats; (2) using code analysis and testing techniques to identify the vulnerabilities of Web applications; and (3) constructing reputation-based blacklists or smart sandbox systems to protect end-users from attacks. We show that these three categories of approaches form an extensive solution space to theWeb-based malware problem.

To understand users' security and privacy perceptions and requirements for secure group chat, we surveyed 996 respondents in the US and UK. Our results show that group chat presents important security and privacy challenges, some of which are not present in one-to-one chat. For example, users need to be able to manage and monitor group membership, establish trust for new group members, and filter content that they share in different chat contexts. We also find that respondents lack mechanisms for determining which tools are secure and instead rely on non-technical strategies for protecting their privacy-for example, self-filtering and carefully tracking group membership.To better understand how these results relate to existing tools, we conduct cognitive walkthroughs (a form of expert usability review) for five popular group chat tools. Our results demonstrate that while existing tools address some items identified in our surveys, this support is partial and is insufficient in many cases. As such, there is a need for improved group chat tools that better align with user perceptions and requirements. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations on improving the security and usability of secure group chat.},

abstract = {It is difficult to discern real-world consequences of attacks on an enterprise when investigating network-centric data alone. In recent years, many tools have been developed to help understand attacks using visualisation, but few aim to predict real-world consequences. We have developed a visualisation tool that aims to improve decision support during attacks in Security Operation Centres (SOCs). Our tool visualises propagation of risks from sensor alert data to Business Process (BP) tasks. This is an important capability gap present in many SOCs today, as most threat detection tools are technology-centric. In this article, we present a user study that assesses our tool's usability and ability to support the analyst. Ten analysts from seven SOCs performed carefully designed tasks related to understanding risks and recovery decision-making.

abstract = {Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) is a driving force for closer interaction between machines and humans in a changing industrial environment. Traditional risk mitigation schemes in industrial machinery typically aim at a strict separating of humans from hazards, either by spatial or temporal barriers. Following this approach, established risk assessment methods for machinery frequently favour a one-step risk reduction of the risk. Furthermore, the number of risk parameters used for the estimation of the level of risk is typically limited, e.g. the experience and education of a user is typically not taken into account when assessing the possibility to avoid a harm. While this simplicities the risk assessment, it imposes limitations for HRC applications, where humans directly interact with e.g. collaborative Robots (Cobots) or Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs). A comprehensive risk assessment is a key factor for the assurance of safety in collaborative applications, which allows for an iterative risk reduction and accounts for the skills and the education of the humans at risk. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of the established risk model for the field of HRC and present COHeReNT, a novel risk estimation method tailored to collaborative applications. Furthermore, we argue that the iterative approach reduces the incentive to defeat safety measures by a tight integration into the working process of the robots. {\textcopyright} ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.},

One popular type of such attacks is the microarchitectural attack, where the adversary exploits the hardware features to break the protection enforced by the operating system and steal the secrets from the program. In this article, we systematize microarchitectural side channels with a focus on attacks and defenses in cryptographic applications. We make three contributions. (1) We survey past research literature to categorize microarchitectural side-channel attacks. Since these are hardware attacks targeting software, we summarize the vulnerable implementations in software, as well as flawed designs in hardware. (2) We identify common strategies to mitigate microarchitectural attacks, from the application, OS, and hardware levels. (3) We conduct a large-scale evaluation on popular cryptographic applications in the real world and analyze the severity, practicality, and impact of side-channel vulnerabilities. This survey is expected to inspire side-channel research community to discover new attacks, and more importantly, propose new defense solutions against them.},

abstract = {Netherlands Railways has developed driver advisory systems (DAS) to provide the train driver with route context information and coasting advice in order to benefit punctuality and energy efficiency. However, the impact of these DAS on human factors aspects and safety performance is unclear. The current study assesses the impact of two DAS levels (route context information and coasting advice) on mental workload, attention allocation and safety performance, using eye tracking, a subjective mental workload rating scale (RSME) and simulator data. The overall findings suggest that the application of DAS levels has no negative impact on safety performance and attention allocation towards the trackside compared to a control condition with static timetable information. Furthermore, safety performance benefits significantly from DAS with route context information. DAS were originally developed to benefit punctuality and energy efficiency goals. This study implicates that DAS can also benefit safety performance. The current study found that DAS could decrease workload when the functionalities meet the requirements of the situation. The possible presence of mental underload and its effect on driving performance should be taken into consideration when implementing DAS. It is essential in the development of DAS that it meaningfully enriches the train driving task in stead of simply increasing mental workload. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {We present techniques for gathering data that expose errors of automatic predictive models. In certain common settings, traditional methods for evaluating predictive models tend to miss rare but important errors-most importantly, cases for which the model is confident of its prediction (but wrong). In this article, we present a system that, in a game-like setting, asks humans to identify cases that will cause the predictive model-based system to fail. Such techniques are valuable in discovering problematic cases that may not reveal themselves during the normal operation of the system and may include cases that are rare but catastrophic. We describe the design of the system, including design iterations that did not quite work. In particular, the system incentivizes humans to provide examples that are difficult for the model to handle by providing a reward proportional to the magnitude of the predictive model's error. The humans are asked to "Beat the Machine" and find cases where the automatic model ("the Machine") is wrong. Experiments show that the humans using Beat the Machine identify more errors than do traditional techniques for discovering errors in predictive models, and, indeed, they identify many more errors where the machine is (wrongly) confident it is correct. Furthermore, those cases the humans identify seem to be not simply outliers, but coherent areas missed completely by the model. Beat the Machine identifies the "unknown unknowns." Beat the Machine has been deployed at an industrial scale by several companies. The main impact has been that firms are changing their perspective on and practice of evaluating predictive models.},

abstract = {The paper concerns the safety of seaborne transportation and it is directly devoted to safety of ships in damaged conditions. There is a lack of methods enabling an assessment of safety of ships after the collision and during the ships salvage. The existing methods can be based on the expert assessment using the brain storming techniques. Then the safety measure can be based on the qualitative risk assessment. The another possibility can be to use the methods of safety assessment of ships in damage conditions which are based on the requirements included in the SOLAS 2009 regulations. These methods are of prescriptive character and they are more devoted to solve the ship design problems than those existing in operation. Therefore this is very difficult to apply these methods directly to assess the safety of ships in damaged conditions after the collision and for the ship salvage purposes. There is a need to introduce a novel method for assessment of safety of ships in damaged conditions during the accident at sea. Such a method based on the damaged ship performance and risk assessment is briefly presented in the paper. The method is based on implementation of the system approach to safety, performance-oriented approach and risk-based approach to safety using the elements of the Formal Safety Assessment FSA. The holistic approach to safety assessment has been applied. An influence of design, operational, management related and human factors has been taken into account. The holistic matrix type risk model has been applied to enable to take into account all the possible scenarios of an accident. This multi-level risk model is based on the event tree analysis ETA and enables to consider the accident scenarios consisting of the hazards, intermediate events, additional events and consequences. The measure of safety of ships in damaged conditions during the accident is the risk level. The risk acceptance criteria can be either the risk matrix or ALARP concept. The paper shows how to use the method and some examples are presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.},

abstract = {Password-composition policies are the result of service providers becoming increasingly concerned about the security of online accounts. These policies restrict the space of user-created passwords to preclude easily guessed passwords and thus make passwords more difficult for attackers to guess. However, many users struggle to create and recall their passwords under strict password-composition policies, for example, ones that require passwords to have at least eight characters with multiple character classes and a dictionary check. Recent research showed that a promising alternative was to focus policy requirements on password length instead of on complexity. In this work, we examine 15 password policies, many focusing on length requirements. In doing so, we contribute the first thorough examination of policies requiring longer passwords. We conducted two online studies with over 20,000 participants, and collected both usability and password-strength data. Our findings indicate that password strength and password usability are not necessarily inversely correlated: policies that lead to stronger passwords do not always reduce usability. We identify policies that are both more usable and more secure than commonly used policies that emphasize complexity rather than length requirements. We also provide practical recommendations for service providers who want their users to have strong yet usable passwords.},

abstract = {Risk assessment is one of the most critical tools used in the safety engineering system in oil and gas construction projects due to it providing the required protection for the construction activities such as pilling, materials fabrication, and structure installation. The main purpose of risk assessment tool is to provide full protection to the four main elements that are crucial to the oil industry: People, Environment, Assets and Reputation (PEAR). The failure or defect in the risk assessment implementation in the construction stage can potentially lead to catastrophes in the advanced stages such as operation and productions. In oil and gas construction projects many historical oil spill and blow outs occurred due to a lack of efficient risk assessment in the construction phase, resulting in financial and human life losses. There are various factors that contribute to the implementation problem in the construction phase, thus, different aspects should be analyzed in the risk assessment structures to determine how the system is very closely linked. Through data analysis, it is evident that the weakness in the implementation can be related to inadequate policy and framework of the risk assessment. Organizational culture affecting employee safety behavior is another contributing reason for faulty implementation. Many scholars try to analyze the implementation problem in the oil and gas sector, along with other heavy industries, through risk regulations, risk planning and human error. This research exposes the defects and challenges in the risk assessment tool in oil and gas construction projects in UAE through a questionnaire survey. The research shows a gap in the understanding and practice of the risk assessment tool between management and operation, especially in the behavioral effects. {\textcopyright} Int. J. of GEOMATE.},

abstract = {Track maintenance work is one of the most hazardous jobs in the rail industry. Track workers are in danger of being fatally injured by rail traffic either on the track they are working on or on adjacent tracks. The rail industry has developed many safe working procedures and protection systems to minimise the risk. The Australian rail industry is now trialling new technology that automatically warns the track workers of approaching trains. These technologies may be added to or ultimately replace the current safe working procedures. As there are different products and technologies available for track worker protection it is not clear which technology is best for the Australian rail environment. The CRC for Rail Innovation project 'R3.120-Track Worker Protection Technology' aims to identify and compare systems that improve protection for track workers. Commercially available systems use different types of technologies and have different safety integrity levels. The effectiveness of a safety system is not only dependent on the technology but also the track workers who operate and are protected by the system. Short-term trials may not highlight all issues across the systems' life cycle so to analyse these socio-technical systems in a relatively short time period a specifically adapted hazard and operability (HAZOP) study is being undertaken. The HAZOP study evaluates both the technical and human factor aspects of the system utilising an expert team. Initially one of the commercially available track worker protection systems was selected as the base for the HAZOP and other track worker protection systems will be analysed based on the issues identified with the initial system. This paper discusses the 'Track Worker Protection Technology' project, the track worker protection technology that is available and the adapted HAZOP used to analyse a track worker safety system as a socio-technical system. {\textcopyright} IMechE 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/ journalsPermissions.nav.},

abstract = { This work is situated in research on Parental Involvement (PI) in Computer Science (CS) Education. While the importance of PI in children's education is well established, most parents have little experience in CS and struggle to facilitate the learning of a child in the area. If PI in CS Education is to happen, then we argue that parents need support and that understanding the current behaviours and attitudes toward CS in the family context is important to discerning the form that support should take. This article therefore describes the development of an instrument to identify factors relating to parental attitudes toward and motivation for PI in CS education. Relevant variables situated in the context of parental computing behaviours and attitudes in the home were identified using a literature review and expert focus group. These include computing usage, availability, confidence, and experience. To measure these variables, a survey instrument was developed and administered to a large sample of parents ( n = 1228). Results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis confirm that the instrument measures five constructs, namely “Confidence,” measuring parental confidence levels with computing; “Attitude to PI”; “Motivation for PI”; and two types of “Usage”: Creation and Consumption. Results of Pearson correlation revealed significant positive relationships between confidence and both positive attitudes toward, and motivation for, PI, with linear regressions confirming that confidence was a significant predictor of both. Regression analysis also identified that creative usage was a predictor of positive attitudes to PI, and that programming experience was a predictor of attitude to, and motivation for, PI. These findings were further validated through triangulation with qualitative data from focus groups with the target population. We conclude that this understanding of the predictors of PI attitudes and motivation should inform the design of initiatives to address parental engagement in CS Education. },

abstract = {This paper investigates how making activities and participation in makerspaces supports the wellbeing and empowerment of women, particularly in making domains that are typically male-dominated. We spent six months undertaking participant observations in a women-only makerspace that runs workshops aimed at teaching women skills in using power tools and woodwork. We conducted contextual interviews with 12 workshop attendees as well as with the makerspace founder and lead instructor. Through the lens of feminist HCI and legitimate peripheral participation, we present trajectories of participation within a women-only makerspace-from beginning as a peripheral participant to becoming a competent and confident maker. We found that through structured workshops in a women-only space that actively teach making skills, the women-only makerspace works to transform the current makerspace landscape so more women can engage with these spaces and participate within them. We contribute three core qualities to foster participation: women-only but without a 'feminist' label, configuring a formal and collaborative learning environment, and reification through artefacts. Collectively these work towards new configurations of makerspaces for women that enable their participation within them, and we detail how such configurations work to create trajectories for women's participation.},

Although these AI technologies offer significant benefits, they can be used maliciously. Highly targeted and evasive attacks in benign carrier applications, such as DeepLocker, have demonstrated the intentional use of AI for harmful purposes. Threat actors are constantly changing and improving their attack strategy with particular emphasis on the application of AI-driven techniques in the attack process, called AI-based cyber attack, which can be used in conjunction with conventional attack techniques to cause greater damage. Despite several studies on AI and security, researchers have not summarized AI-based cyber attacks enough to be able to understand the adversary's actions and to develop proper defenses against such attacks. This study aims to explore existing studies of AI-based cyber attacks and to map them onto a proposed framework, providing insight into new threats. Our framework includes the classification of several aspects of malicious uses of AI during the cyber attack life cycle and provides a basis for their detection to predict future threats. We also explain how to apply this framework to analyze AI-based cyber attacks in a hypothetical scenario of a critical smart grid infrastructure.},

abstract = {The incremental diffusion of machine learning algorithms in supporting cybersecurity is creating novel defensive opportunities but also new types of risks. Multiple researches have shown that machine learning methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that create tiny perturbations aimed at decreasing the effectiveness of detecting threats. We observe that existing literature assumes threat models that are inappropriate for realistic cybersecurity scenarios, because they consider opponents with complete knowledge about the cyber detector or that can freely interact with the target systems. By focusing on Network Intrusion Detection Systems based on machine learning, we identify and model the real capabilities and circumstances required by attackers to carry out feasible and successful adversarial attacks. We then apply our model to several adversarial attacks proposed in literature and highlight the limits and merits that can result in actual adversarial attacks. The contributions of this article can help hardening defensive systems by letting cyber defenders address the most critical and real issues and can benefit researchers by allowing them to devise novel forms of adversarial attacks based on realistic threat models.},

To protect IS and information assets from insider threats, information security awareness (ISA) has been established as a crucial factor in influencing employees' behaviour that is supportive or disruptive of IS security. But yet to date, there is still a lack of in-depth and structured understanding of the factors influencing ISA. In this research-in-progress paper, we conduct a literature review to categorize determinants of ISA into four levels of origin (individual, organizational, social-environmental, and application-specific) and identify topics that are promising for future research. We then present our planned study as an example to pursue our recommendations. In the IS security context of phishing, we aim to uncover the extent to which non-IS professionals are able to develop an eye for technical aspects of IS security and pay higher visual attention to security and fraud indicators of web browsers and emails after being subject to different organizational awareness-raising activities. Among a survey and literature analysis, the multi-method approach uses the objective data collection instrument of eye tracking. We expect to contribute into the nascent area of neurosecurity research by offering new insights on the effectiveness of organizational means to increase employees' ISA.},

abstract = {Safety Instrumented System (SIS) standards improved the definition of interlocks and introduced requirements for improved management systems to enforce independence from other Independent Protection Layers (IPLs). SIS standards require verification that the performance of each Safety Instrumented Function (SIF) will be met during its lifetime; where the performance criterion is documented as the target Safety Integrity Level (SIL) or risk reduction factor for the SIF. The SIL is in turn tied to specific values of probability of failure on demand (PFD). The current SIS standards and the TR (Technical Reports, from ISA) that explain how to do SIL Verification calculations do not include accounting for specific human error probabilities - this is a major deficiency as even the probability of a single human error can be much larger than the target PFD of 0.001 for a SIL 3 and oftentimes a little larger than the PFD of 0.01 for a SIL 2. The SIL Verification methods outlined in the standards and technical reports like ANSI/ISA TR84.00.02 facilitate consistency for the component-only failure rates. As user companies seek to obtain greater risk reduction from their SIS to satisfy their corporate risk criteria, failure to adequately address potential specific human failures can lead to overly optimistic results and a misallocation of resources intended to reduce risk This paper shows that specific human error during testing, calibration maintenance, and restoration of a SIF is a significant contribution to the true PFD of the SIF for SIL 2 and dominates SIL 3 designs. Unless the human errors are accounted for and then compensated for, it is more likely to find a Unicorn than to actually get two or three orders of risk reduction from SIL 2 and SIL 3 SIFs. Example methods for human error analysis related to a SIS are provided as well as some proven approaches for controlling human factors. The paper also discusses ways to prevent or else to detect and to recover from errors made in redundant channels (such as used in 1oo2, 1oo3, or 2oo3 voting). {\textcopyright} 2018.

abstract = {In recent years, the concept of resilience has been introduced in risk analysis and some approaches have been proposed as an alternative (or a complement) to the conventional safety assessment for sociotechnical systems. In that way, Integrated Risk Analysis (IRA) has been developed at EDF to treat different risk causalities linking human, organizational, technical and environmental factors in a unified framework using performance shaping factors (PSF). However, research is still needed to address the issues relating to the modelling of resilience when considering organizational influences on human activities. Thus, this paper aims contributing at the definition and derivation of resilient markers and, consequently, to consider both resilient and pathogenic organizational patterns in a unified risk model. The risk model is initially proposed as a fourth generation method of risk analysis based on probabilistic graphical modelling of causal mechanisms. The model is proposed for safety assessment of technical systems integrating human, environmental and organizational factors. Finally, the feasibility of our proposals is shown on an illustrative case of Integrated Risk Analysis (IRA). {\textcopyright} 2016},

An argument is made for new system design requirements based on a threat sustainable system (TSS) drawing on threat scanning, flexibility, command and control, system of systems, human factors and population dependencies. Principles of sustainability used in historical design processes are considered alongside the complex changes of technology and emerging threat actors. The paper recognises that technologies and development methods for safety do not work for security. Safety has the notion of a one or two event protection, but cyber-attacks are multi-event situations. The paper recognizes that the behaviour of interconnected systems and modern systems requirements for national sustainability. System security principles for sustainability of critical systems are considered in relation to failure, security architecture, quality of service, authentication and trust and communication of failure to operators. Design principles for operators are discussed along with recognition of human factors failures. These principles are then applied as the basis for recommended changes in systems design and discuss system control dominating the hierarchy of design decisions but with harmonization of safety requirements up to the level of sustaining security. These new approaches are discussed as the basis for future research on adaptive flexible systems that can sustain attacks and the uncertainty of fast-changing technology. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

The CRIOP method is focusing on human operations, through control centres or control cabins. The method has been adapted to learn from successful recoveries and accidents to improve human dependability. The method tries to ensure that key issues are identified early. It is suggested to build resilience through organisational and system design and support teamwork as a key factor in improving resilience. This should be done through learning from incidents and recoveries, through scenario discussions exploring critical tasks and human machine interfaces from design.

abstract = {This paper emphasizes the importance of creating a hybrid Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), capable of covering the interactions of risk contributing factors (e.g. hardware, software, and human aspects of systems, as well as their organizational and regulatory environments). Traditional PRAs use statistical data and expert opinion for estimating the probability of "basic events" in order to calculate system risk. More recently, the focus has been shifting toward modeling the underlying failure mechanisms of the elements of risk scenarios and consequently, PRA requires roots in diverse fields such as reliability engineering, cognitive psychology, organizational behavior, and computer science. This paper provides two building blocks for a hybrid PRA: The first block describes (a) a multi-level framework, called Socio-Technical Risk Analysis (SoTeRiA), as a theoretical foundation for the integration of technical system risk models with both the social features (e.g. safety culture) and the structural aspects (e.g. safety practice) of the organization operating the system and (b) appropriate techniques to operationalize and quantify the SoTeRiA framework. It is argued that using a single modeling technique is insufficient due to the multidisciplinary nature of complex system risk assessments, and a hybrid inclusion of deterministic and probabilistic methods is proposed. The second block relates to the incorporation of physical failure mechanisms into PRAs and its application for modeling Common Cause Failures (CCFs). Last year's disaster at the Japanese Fukushima Daiichi Power Plant is an example that highlights the criticality of modeling CCFs. The purpose is to build a theoretical foundation for the incorporation of Probabilistic Physics-Of-Failure (PPOF) models into PRA in a way that the interactions of physical failure mechanisms (e.g. fatigue and wear) and, ultimately, the dependencies among multiple component failures can be depicted.},

Even if the concept of inherent safety, strongly promoted by Trevor Kletz, represents one of the main lessons from this tragedy, in the first part of the paper we focus on Bhopal mitigation measures representing the ultimate relevant layer of protection. Starting from a technical analysis of the whole safety equipment of the plant and relevant empirical evidences, we face the short-cut design of critical safety devices suitable to mitigate release effects. The applied method allows a preliminary design and management tool to evaluate the effectiveness of safety systems and the impact on surroundings. In the second part, we develop an empirical-based framework allowing to identify emergency actions and intervention time and demonstrate how the implementation of these safety measures when reaching a critical pressure of 10 psig in Tank 610, even under the condition of protective equipment out of commission, would have surely mitigated such a high profile tragedy.

Recently, the application of Industry 4.0 elements has become a key tool for them, and they are based on the need of automation application within production processes. Despite that, there are several activities and processes, which cannot be fully replaced with automation elements, and for their functioning, it is necessary to use a human-machine interface.

Using data from real Bizum users and structural equation modelling, it was confirmed that: (1) customers' attitudes and perceptions of control over the mobile app increased use and WOM intentions; (2) the subjective norm (i.e., social approval) is not important for the adoption of this P2P service; (3) the direct effect of perceived risk on behavioural intentions is not significant and that perceived risk is moderated by perceived security, such that its negative effects are significant when users perceive lower levels of security; (4) age and gender do not significantly influence adoption, which suggests that the service might be used by a wide spectrum. Finally, from a practical viewpoint, this research contributes to the understanding of the success factors underlying P2P platforms, which can help managers better develop their market penetration strategies in a highly competitive sector. {\textcopyright} 2022},

But also other requirements (recently emerged), such as privacy preservation with risk metrics, explainability, and ephemeral messages. We explore all the advances made in the literature, and we have seen that most of these have been focused on matching the users' preferences with their decision (which is not appropriate, because users cannot evaluate all of the potential privacy scenarios) instead of assessing privacy risk metrics, adaptation, and explainability. Therefore, we have identified open challenges, such as metrics for assessing privacy risks, explainable solutions for users, ephemeral communication solutions, and the application of these requirements to the multi-party privacy scenario.},

The literature reveals that several K-16 interventions have been designed to increase the representation of Black women and girls in computing. Despite these best efforts, the needle seems to have barely moved in increasing the representation or the retention of Black women in computing. Instead, the primary goals have been to recruit and retain women in the CS pipeline using gender-focused efforts intended to increase the number of women who also identify as members of racialized groups. However, these gender-focused efforts have fallen short of increasing the number of Black women in computing because they fail to acknowledge or appreciate how intersectionality (the overlapping social constructs of gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc.) has shaped the lived experiences of Black women navigating the computing pipeline. Without honest dialogue about how power operates in the field of computing, the push for racial equality and social justice in CS education remains an elusive goal. Leveraging intersectionality as a critical framework to address systemic oppression (i.e., racism, gender discrimination, power, and privilege), we interview 24 Black women in different phases of the computing pipeline about their experiences navigating the field of computing. An intersectional analysis of Black women's experiences reveals that CS education consists of saturated sites of violence in which interconnected systems of power converge to enact oppression. Findings reveal three primary saturated sites of violence within CS education: (1) traditional K-12 classrooms; (2) predominantly White institutions; and (3) internships as supplementary learning experiences. We conclude the article with implications for how the field of CS education can begin to address racial inequality that negatively impacts Black girls and women, thus contributing to a more equitable and socially just field of study that benefits all students.},

The aim of this article is to propose a methodology to develop a generic task type–performance-influencing factor structure, specific for application to a domain of interest and directly linked to an underlying cognitive framework of literature. The structure provides the foundation of a human reliability analysis method built on the generic task type concept; it identifies the sector-specific performance-influencing factor effects on the failure probability that the method needs to represent and quantify for each generic task type. The methodology is intended to support a systematic and traceable process to develop the generic task type–performance-influencing factor structure, to ease the review of the process and of its results and, in case, identify and implement changes to the structure. The proposed methodology is applied to the radiotherapy domain allowing the development of sector-specific taxonomies of representative critical tasks, their failure modes, underlying cognitive failure mechanism, and influencing performance-influencing factors. This is part of a broader activity carried out by the Risk and Human Reliability Group at the Paul Scherrer Institute of Switzerland to develop a human reliability analysis method, specific for the radiotherapy domain. The activity is conducted in close cooperation with Paul Scherrer Institute's Center for Proton Therapy, where a first application of the method is foreseen. {\textcopyright} 2017, {\textcopyright} IMechE 2017.},

abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this study is to encourage management boards to recognize that employees play a major role in the management of information security. Thus, these issues need to be addressed efficiently, especially in organizations in which data are a valuable asset. Design/methodology/approach - Before developing the instrument for the survey, first, effective measurement built upon existing literature review was identified and developed and the survey questionnaires were set according to past studies and the findings based on qualitative analyses. Data were collected by using cross-sectional questionnaire and a Likert scale, whereby each question was related to an item as in the work of Witherspoon et al. (2013). Data analysis was done using the SPSS.3B. Findings - Based on the results from three surveys and findings, a principle of information security compliance practices was proposed based on the authors' proposed nine-five-circle (NFC) principle that enhances information security management by identifying human conduct and IT security-related issues regarding the aspect of information security management. Furthermore, the authors' principle has enabled closing the gap between technology and humans in this study by proving that the factors in the present study's finding are interrelated and work together, rather than on their own. Research limitations/implications - The main objective of this study was to address the lack of research evidence on what mobilizes and influences information security management development and implementation. This objective has been fulfilled by surveying, collecting and analyzing data and by giving an account of the attributes that hinder information security management. Accordingly, a major practical contribution of the present research is the empirical data it provides that enable obtaining a bigger picture and precise information about the real issues that cause information security management shortcomings. Practical implications - In this sense, despite the fact that this study has limitations concerning the development of a diagnostic tool, it is obviously the main procedure for the measurements of a framework to assess information security compliance policies in the organizations surveyed. Social implications - The present study's discoveries recommend in actuality that using flexible tools that can be scoped to meet individual organizational needs have positive effects on the implementation of information security management policies within an organization. Accordingly, the research proposes that organizations should forsake the oversimplified generalized guidelines that neglect the verification of the difference in information security requirements in various organizations. Instead, they should focus on the issue of how to sustain and enhance their organization's compliance through a dynamic compliance process that involves awareness of the compliance regulation, . controlling integration and closing gaps Originality/value - The rapid growth of information technology (IT) has created numerous business opportunities. At the same time, this growth has increased information security risk. IT security risk is an important issue in industrial sectors, and in organizations that are innovating owing to globalization or changes in organizational culture. Previously, technology-associated risk assessments focused on various technology factors, but as of the early twenty-first century, the most important issue identified in technology risk studies is the human factor. {\textcopyright} Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Lacking a holistic framework for analyzing risk factors would result in the inaccurate assessment of safety performance and poor safety management. This research aims to establish a Bayesian-network (BN)-HFACS hybrid model to proactively predict safety performance in construction projects. First, a causation framework for analyzing the underlying factors influencing construction safety performance was established using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). This causation framework incorporates 18 risk factors from organizational, environmental and human aspects that are categorized into five levels: L1: “unsafe acts of workers,” L2: “preconditions for unsafe acts,” L3: “unsafe supervision and monitoring,” L4: “adverse organizational influences,” and L5: “adverse environmental influences.” The relationships between these factors and project safety performance were then hypothesized in the BN-HFACS model, and validated by data collected with questionnaires. The proposed model was applied to a subway project with AgenaRisk software. This application demonstrated the model's capabilities in systematically identifying risk factors, predicting the probabilities of safety states in project level and in the five specific cause levels, and diagnosing the most sensitive risk factor. This research contributes to safety assessment and management by modifying the original HFACS for the causation analysis of construction safety performance, and by establishing a BN model for quantifying the total influences of the risk factors at five distinct levels on project safety performance. The integration of HFACS and BNs may be instructive in other contexts where diverse safety risk factors are involved in a system and safety prediction of the system is necessary.},

We note several recurring themes. First, users' desires for convenience and connectedness dictate their privacy-related behaviors for dealing with external entities, such as device manufacturers, Internet Service Providers, governments, and advertisers. Second, user opinions about external entities collecting smart home data depend on perceived benefit from these entities. Third, users trust IoT device manufacturers to protect their privacy but do not verify that these protections are in place. Fourth, users are unaware of privacy risks from inference algorithms operating on data from non-audio/visual devices. These findings motivate several recommendations for device designers, researchers, and industry standards to better match device privacy features to the expectations and preferences of smart home owners.},

Moreover, the factors leading to accidents are often human factors, so safety evaluation of these factors for the hydropower projects' work system is very significant. The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) framework is applied to build evaluation system. In the evaluation process, correlation analysis is used to form the intercriteria analysis matrix that helps the decision makers to build impact relation matrix. Factor weights are calculated by the Analytic Network Process (ANP). In the index value determination step, the evidence theory is used to eliminate the conflicts of three decision makers and the index values are then calculated.

abstract = {In safety-critical systems such as marine engine plant operation, we always hope that the operator could persistently monitor system parameters (e.g. engine revolution) and adapt to unforeseen changes (e.g. lubrication oil pressure low) and avoid any misses or incidents (e.g. engine shut down), in other words, to perform their jobs perfectly. With the improvement of hardware reliability, it is the abnormal psychophysiological state of the operator that more likely lead to performance degradation of the system. Thus it is necessary to address how to maintain the optimal operator functional state (OFS) in the context of human-machine systems, where the risk of accident is closely related to human component. Physiological computing is to correlate an operator's physiological changes and their functional states based on simple selected features or complex algorithms such as support vector machine and fuzzy modelling. The physiological evaluation indices mainly include heart rate variability (HRV) recorded from electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure, respiration, eye blinks and pupil diameter, skin potential, hemodynamic indices and cerebral cortex indices such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs). This paper aims to review the psychophysiological indices that are widely used to predict human cognitive states in both cognitive psychology research and applied industries. Possible applications of physiological computing in maritime human factors are suggested. A marine engine power-plant simulator operation study is done to evaluate operators' mental workload based on chosen psychophysiological indices and physiological computing methods. Significance tests show that alpha band wave ratio is effective for referring subject's mental workload. {\textcopyright} 2015: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.},

abstract = {Many industrial accidents occur at construction sites. Several countries are instating safety management measures to reduce industrial accidents at construction sites. However, there are few technical measures relevant to this task, and there are safety blind spots related to differences in human resources' capabilities. We propose a deep convolutional neural network that automatically recognizes possible material and human risk factors in the field regardless of individual management capabilities. The most suitable learning method and model for this study's task and environment were experimentally identified, and visualization was performed to increase the interpretability of the model's prediction results. The fine-tuned Safety-MobileNet model showed a high performance of 99.79% (30 ms), demonstrating its high potential to be applied in actual construction sites. In addition, via visualization, the cause of the model's confusion of classes could be found in a dataset that the model did not predict correctly, and insights for result analysis could be presented. The material and human risk factor recognition model presented in this study can contribute to solving various practical problems, such as the absence of accident prevention systems, the limitations of human resources for safety management, and the difficulties in applying safety management systems to small construction companies. {\textcopyright} 2022 by the authors.

Over the past four decades, Professor Neville Stanton has contributed to over 179 journal articles, book chapters and conference papers in the field of road safety. The journey from ‘thinking humans' to ‘systems thinking' is demonstrated in this paper through the novel application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to the categorisation of research activities. A systematic review of Neville's contributions to the field of road safety demonstrates that over the years, his research activities have evolved from investigating single technological or human performance aspects in isolation (e.g., in-vehicle information design and workload) through to the holistic analysis of much broader systems (e.g., investigating road safety as a whole). Importantly, this evolution goes hand in hand with a change in the focus and emphasis of recommendations for improvements to safety. Going forward, Neville has helped pave the way for fundamental changes and improvements to be made to road safety systems around the world. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Purpose-This study aims, firstly, to determine what influence the information security policy has on the information security culture by comparing the culture of employees who read the policy to those who do not, and, secondly, whether a stronger information security culture is embedded over time if more employees have read the information security policy. Design/methodology/approach-An empirical study is conducted at four intervals over eight years across 12 countries using a validated information security culture assessment (ISCA) questionnaire. Findings-The overall information security culture average scores as well as individual statements for all four survey assessments were significantly more positive for employees who had read the information security policy compared with employees who had not. The overall information security culture also improved from one assessment to the next. Research limitations/implications-The information security culture should be measured and benchmarked over time to monitor change and identify and prioritise actions to improve the information security culture. If employees read the information security policy, it has a positive influence on the information security culture of an organisation. Practical implications-Organisations should ensure that employees have read the information security policy to aid in minimising the human risk, related errors and incidents and, ultimately, to instil a stronger information security culture with a higher level of compliant behaviour. Originality/value-This research confirms theoretical research indicating that the information security policy could influence the information security culture positively. It provides novel and statistical evidence illustrating that if employees read the information security policy, they have a stronger information security culture and that the culture can be improved through targeted interventions using an ISCA. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {The outstanding performance of deep neural networks has promoted deep learning applications in a broad set of domains. However, the potential risks caused by adversarial samples have hindered the large-scale deployment of deep learning. In these scenarios, adversarial perturbations, imperceptible to human eyes, significantly decrease the model's final performance. Many papers have been published on adversarial attacks and their countermeasures in the realm of deep learning. Most focus on evasion attacks, where the adversarial examples are found at test time, as opposed to poisoning attacks where poisoned data is inserted into the training data. Further, it is difficult to evaluate the real threat of adversarial attacks or the robustness of a deep learning model, as there are no standard evaluation methods. Hence, with this paper, we review the literature to date. Additionally, we attempt to offer the first analysis framework for a systematic understanding of adversarial attacks. The framework is built from the perspective of cybersecurity so as to provide a lifecycle for adversarial attacks and defenses.},

abstract = {The limited ability of existing safety models to properly reflect crash causality has its source in cross-sectional analysis applied to the estimation of the intrinsically complex safety factors with highly aggregated and frequently poor quality of data. The adequacy of the data may be improved thanks to the unprecedented progress in sensing technologies and the invention of the naturalistic driving method of data collection. Proposed in this paper is a new modeling paradigm that integrates several types of safety models. The primary improvement results from a more adequate representation of the crash occurrence process by incorporating crash precursor events into the modeling framework. A Pareto-based estimating method for the likelihood of a collision occurrence, given a precursor event, is explained and illustrated with the simple example of road departures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Existing aspect-based/category sentiment analysis methods have shown great success in detecting sentiment polarity towards a given aspect in a sentence with supervised learning, where the training and inference stages share the same pre-defined set of aspects. However, in practice, the aspect categories are changing rather than keeping fixed over time. Dealing with unseen aspect categories is under-explored in existing methods. In this paper, we formulate a new few-shot aspect category sentiment analysis (FSACSA) task, which aims to effectively predict the sentiment polarity of previously unseen aspect categories. To this end, we propose a novel Aspect-Focused Meta-Learning (AFML) framework, which constructs aspect-aware and aspect-contrastive representations from external knowledge to match the target aspect with aspects in the training set. Concretely, we first construct two auxiliary contrastive sentences for a given sentence with the incorporation of external knowledge, enabling the learning of sentence representations with a better generalization. Then, we devise an aspect-focused induction network to leverage the contextual sentiment towards a given aspect to refine the label vectors. Furthermore, we employ the episode-based meta-learning algorithm to train the whole network, so as to learn to generalize to novel aspects. Extensive experiments on multiple real-life datasets show that our proposed AFML framework achieves the state-of-the-art results for the FSACSA task.},

Many studies have been conducted on human factors influence on construction accidents. The human factor analysis and classification system (HFACS) is developed to establish a rational and applicable index system for investigating human error in accidents. Also, currently the lambda test is used for the correlation analysis of factors; while the factors are assessed by the methods of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and the analytic network process (ANP). We extend the HFACS to evaluate the faulty behavioral risk value in this work. The degrees of interaction between independent factors that involved the data used for constructing the direct-relation matrix in DEMATEL are analyzed via the lambda correlation measurement method. The causal graph and calculate results obtained by DEMATEL shows that "safety supervision and inspection" and "organization and responsibility" are the most important factors. Moreover, the empirical study shows that the hybrid method is more suitable and effective than the traditional ANP method. The evaluation model incorporating DEMATEL and ANP takes into account the interaction between factors and their self-feedback, which are more suitable than the traditional method to solve problems with different degrees of effects among clusters. The weights of construction accident factors calculated by the ANP model and the causal graph derived from DEMATEL method both provide suggestions for safety management in the high-risk work systems of several large hydropower-construction projects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Starting with the earliest developments, data for HRA has been persistently viewed as lacking.

This paper presents a review of the literature aimed at assessing the state of HRA data. Based on an overview of existing databases, it attempts to relate the various sources of data and databases by considering the relationships among the types of data and the associated applications of the data. There are key distinctions among the intended applications of the data, with implications for data they require. Even if HRA methods share common traits, the diversity of HRA methods has also resulted in method-specific data requirements. Moreover, the sensitivity and, in some cases, the proprietary character of the data represents additional challenges.

abstract = {The interchange merging area suffers a high crash risk in the freeway system, which is greatly related to the intense mandatory merging maneuvers. Ignoring such correlation may result in limited and biased conclusions and inefficient countermeasures. Recently, the availability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides us an opportunity to collect individual vehicle's data to conduct traffic analysis at the microscopic level. Hence, this paper contributes to the literature by proposing a new framework to analyze crash risk at freeway interchange merging areas considering drivers' merging behavior. The analysis framework is conducted based on individual vehicle data from UAV videos. A multilevel random parameters logistic regression model is proposed to investigate each driver's merging behavior in the acceleration lane. The model could identify the impact of different factors related to traffic and drivers on the merging behavior. Then, the crash risk between the merging vehicle and surrounding vehicles is calculated by incorporating the time-to-collision (TTC) and the output of the estimated merging behavior's model. The results suggest that the proposed method provides more valuable insights about the crash risk at interchange merging areas by simultaneously considering the merging behavior and the safety measure. It is concluded that the merging speed, driving ability (e.g., lane change confidence, lane-keeping instability), and the merging location can affect the crash risk. These results can help traffic engineers propose efficient countermeasures to enhance the safety of the interchange merging area. The results also have implications to the design of merging areas and the advent of connected vehicles' technology. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {The US power grid has been identified by security experts as a prime target for terrorist-based and state-sponsored cyber attacks. In addition to downing the grid, cyber attacks can also destroy and manipulate data systems, obtain sensitive intellectual property and steal trade secrets. Existing research has addressed the technical factors, such as vulnerabilities and poor intrusion detection systems, which lead to cyber attacks. However, it remains silent on the human factors in the cyber attack equation. This study uses a criminological framework, specifically Routine Activities Theory and Rational Choice Perspective to capture intelligent adversaries who plan and execute attacks based on their analysis of target suitability and guardianship efficacy. It uses a two-step methodology to identify adversary-, target-, and guardianship-specific factors that collectively impact decision-making processes. First, a document analysis of existing literature reveals nine factors (PARE RISKS) that influence adversarial decision-making: Prevention measures, Attacks and Alliances, Results, Ease of Access, Response and Recovery, Interconnectedness and Interdependencies, Security Testing, Assessments and Audits, Knowledge, Skills, Research and Development, and System Weaknesses. Second, surveys and interviews conducted between 2010 and 2012 with various hackers, penetration testers, and power grid representatives helps validate and refine the PARE RISKS framework. This study identifies (i) adversary-specific factors as resources (skills, money, and time), and research (targets and techniques); (ii) target-specific factors as accessibility (electronic and physical) and weaknesses (outdated architecture and inadequate testing/updates); and (iii) guardian-specific factors as prevention (quality of prevention and intrusion detection measures). It argues that altering each of these three elements of Routine Activities Theory can impact adversarial decisionmaking, which may help reduce the likelihood of power grid cyber attacks.},

RBA monitors features during login, and requests re-authentication when feature values widely differ from previously observed ones. It is recommended by various national security organizations, and users perceive it more usable and equally secure than equivalent two-factor authentication. Despite that, RBA is still only used by very few online services. Reasons for this include a lack of validated open resources on RBA properties, implementation, and configuration. This effectively hinders the RBA research, development, and adoption progress.To close this gap, we provide the first long-term RBA analysis on a real-world large-scale online service. We collected feature data of 3.3 million users and 31.3 million login attempts over more than one year. Based on the data, we provide (i) studies on RBA's real-world characteristics, and its configurations and enhancements to balance usability, security, and privacy, (ii) a machine learning based RBA parameter optimization method to support administrators finding an optimal configuration for their own use case scenario, (iii) an evaluation of the round-trip time feature's potential to replace the IP address for enhanced user privacy, and (iv) a synthesized RBA data set to reproduce this research and to foster future RBA research. Our results provide insights on selecting an optimized RBA configuration so that users profit from RBA after just a few logins.

Healthcare organisations have been encouraged to learn from safety management practices in other industries. In this paper we analyse opportunities and challenges for the application of Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) in healthcare. We consider the poor levels of reliability of many healthcare processes, performance variability, the absence of regulatory frameworks that incentivise proactive risk management, and the unique role of the patient. We conclude that HRA could provide a useful framework for the analysis and reduction of risk in healthcare, but techniques might have to be adapted and applied with due consideration of the specifics of the cultural and regulatory context of this domain. This includes clinical engagement with and ownership of the HRA process, greater focus on rigorous evaluation of cost-effectiveness of HRA techniques, and active involvement of patients. {\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {One of the fundamental assumptions made when using standard LOPA (Layer of Protection Analysis) is that the barriers selected for a common threat path are independent. In most cases the analysis made by the LOPA team is adequate to judge the degree of independence between barriers. However, this may not always be the case, especially when the desired LOPA target is less than 1e-4 per year. In these cases, LOPA is more susceptible to unaccounted for system effects, than to independent random failures (what LOPA assumes). Another way to say this is that whenever a model (for example, LOPA) predicts that a failure will occur with a negligible chance, the probability that the model can fail becomes important. Potential failure paths can emerge between barriers in a common threat path due to what is known as "system effects." That is, to the interaction between otherwise independent barriers due to common support systems (for example, Maintenance), or other Operational or Management impacts. Emergence is a system effect that cannot be identified through other methods, such as IPL (Independent Protection Layer) validation. However, Human Factors methods exist that provide a framework for discovering emergent failures between barriers due to system effects. This paper will discuss the application of one such system technique known as "NET-HARMS" (Networked Hazard Analysis and Risk Management System). The NET-HARMS technique is a combination of two well-established Human Factors methods, the first being HTA (Hierarchical Task Analysis) and secondly, a modified SHERPA (Systematic Human Error Reduction and Prediction Approach) as the taxonomy used to classify system failures. Both methods are easy to use and can be learned quickly with a little practice. The author has several years' worth of experience applying these methods to difficult LOPA problems involving administrative controls, and will show how this analysis can be extended to include hardware barriers as well. {\textcopyright} 2018.

abstract = {Businesses in the smart home sector are actively promoting the benefits of smart home technologies for consumers, such as convenience, economy and home security. To better understand meanings of and trust in the smart home, we carried out a nationally representative survey of UK consumers designed to measure adoption and acceptability, focusing on awareness, ownership, experience, trust, satisfaction and intention to use. We analysed the results using theories of meanings and acceptability of technologies including semiotics, social construction of technology (SCOT) and sociotechnical affordance. Our findings suggest that the meaning and value proposition of the smart home have not yet achieved closure for consumers, but is already foregrounding risks to privacy and security amongst the other meaning-making possibilities it could afford. Anxiety about the likelihood of a security incident emerges as a prominent factor influencing adoption of smart home technology. This factor negatively impacts adoption. These findings underline how businesses and policymakers will need to work together to act on the sociotechnical affordances of smart home technology in order to increase consumers' trust. This intervention is necessary if barriers to adoption and acceptability of the smart home are to be addressed now and in the future. {\textcopyright} 2020 Cannizzaro et al.},

abstract = {<p>Malware analysis is an essential task to understand infection campaigns, the behavior of malicious codes, and possible ways to mitigate threats. Malware analysis also allows better assessment of attackers' capabilities, techniques, and processes. Although a substantial amount of previous work provided a comprehensive analysis of the international malware ecosystem, research on regionalized, country-, and population-specific malware campaigns have been scarce. Moving towards addressing this gap, we conducted a longitudinal (2012-2020) and comprehensive (encompassing an entire population of online banking users) study of MS Windows desktop malware that actually infected Brazilian banks' users. We found that the Brazilian financial desktop malware has been evolving quickly: it started to make use of a variety of file formats instead of typical PE binaries, relied on native system resources, and abused obfuscation techniques to bypass detection mechanisms. Our study on the threats targeting a significant population on the ecosystem of the largest and most populous country in Latin America can provide invaluable insights that may be applied to other countries' user populations, especially those in the developing world that might face cultural peculiarities similar to Brazil's. With this evaluation, we expect to motivate the security community/industry to seriously consider a deeper level of customization during the development of next-generation anti-malware solutions, as well as to raise awareness towards regionalized and targeted Internet threats.</p>},

abstract = {Although the vast majority of construction accidents are caused by workers' unsafe behavior, the management of safety behavior remains inadequate. To reduce unsafe behaviors, construction managers have mainly relied on external formal controls (e.g., penalties) to prevent a violation of safety rules. However, a number of studies recently demonstrated that social factors such as group norms and social identification play a critical role in shaping workers' safety behavior. Although previous studies have illuminated the social aspect of safety behavior, there is a noticeable paucity of research addressing the mechanism that underlies the link between cognitive prcess, social influence, and safety behavior. To address this issue, this study aims to understand the effect of workers' socio-cognitive processes on their safety behavior using experimental analyses with computer simulations. An agent-based model was developed to perform experimental analyses by incorporating the theoretical cognitive model of safety behavior and empirical finding regarding social influence. Then, model experiments were conducted to explore the effect of the interaction between the socio-cognitive process and different management interventions on workers' safety behaviors. The results indicate that frequent managerial feedback has a positive but limited influence on workers' safety behavior. In addition, it was also found that workers' safety behavior can be further improved by combining the strict managers' risk acceptance and stimulation of workers' project-based identity. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on construction safety by modeling the socio-cognitive mechanism of safety behavior and exploring how the mechanism interacts with different management interventions. {\textcopyright} 2017 ASCE.},

abstract = {In today's age of information and communication technology (ICT), many companies are using advanced digital technologies as well as the application of information technology to grow the company and effectively manage their processes. The risk management of information technology plays a crucial role in protecting the important information and data assets of an enterprise. The key objective of risk management in information technology is to safeguard the digital infrastructure from ICT-related harm. An efficient as well as cost effective risk managing mechanism is an integral aspect of an extensive safety system for information technology. A successful approach to IT risk management would strive to protect the company and its infrastructure, not just its digital assets, to conduct their process. Subsequently, the risk managing mechanism must not be viewed solely for instance as a procedural task performed by the IT specialists who run and administer the IT program but as the organization's critical management task. The risks of information technology assets are of a dynamic nature; different strategies tackle the management of information security risk. This research paper is intended to review and discuss information technology risk managing procedures. We also carried out a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)-based empirical investigation to analyses and prioritized different IT risk factors. This has recognized that there are many reports on the techniques, and that various approaches to risk management exist. {\textcopyright} 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The scheme analyzes the interaction between two modules: one represents n{\"{a}}ive users, while the other represents risky webpages.

The proposed scheme is tested on a real-world dataset of HTTP logs provided by a large American toolbar company. The results suggest that a feedback learning process involving webpages and users can improve the scoring accuracy and lead to the detection of unknown malicious webpages.},

abstract = {This paper develops the quantification framework of a new Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) method, for application to the radiotherapy domain. The method's reference data is obtained via expert judgment, due to the lack of domain-specific data. To avoid shortcomings of directly eliciting probabilities, experts are asked to assess the importance of specific factors for the failure probability, elicited on a qualitative scale. Each assessment is converted into statements about the order of magnitude of the probability value. The values are combined via an expert aggregation method, developed specifically for HRA. The paper includes an attempt to validate the elicitation against applicable Human Error Probability (HEP) values from existing HRA methods (thus, “convergent validation”). Indeed, some tasks are generic in nature and data can be assumed to be sector-independent (e.g. checking activities, interacting with interfaces, simple tasks such as identifying objects or characters/numbers). Differences in the values are identified and, when possible, linked to differences in the performance context characteristic of the field of application of the different methods. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

However, very little research has used these systems to evaluate the risk-taking behavior of construction workers. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and usefulness of providing passive haptics in a mixed-reality environment to capture the risk-taking behavior of workers, identify at-risk workers, and propose injury-prevention interventions to counteract excessive risk-taking and risk-compensatory behavior. Within a mixed-reality environment in a CAVE-like display system, our subjects installed shingles on a (physical) sloped roof of a (virtual) two-story residential building on a morning in a suburban area. Through this controlled, within-subject experimental design, we exposed each subject to three experimental conditions by manipulating the level of safety intervention. Workers' subjective reports, physiological signals, psychophysical responses, and reactionary behaviors were then considered as promising measures of Presence. The results showed that our mixed-reality environment was a suitable platform for triggering behavioral changes under different experimental conditions and for evaluating the risk perception and risk-taking behavior of workers in a risk-free setting. These results demonstrated the value of immersive technology to investigate natural human factors. {\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE.},

Understanding the essence of the pedestrian crash is important to the development of effective safety countermeasures and improvement of social well-being. It is necessary to measure the exposure for the quantification of pedestrian crash risk. The primary goals of this study are to explore the efficient exposure measure for pedestrian crash, and identify the possible factors contributing to the incidence of pedestrian crash. In this study, amount of travel was estimated based on the Travel Characteristic Survey (TCS) data in 2011, and the crash data were obtained from the Transport Information System (TIS) of the Hong Kong Transport Department during the period from 2011 to 2015. Total population, walking frequency and walking time were adopted to represent the pedestrian exposure to road crash. The effect of trip purpose on pedestrian crash was evaluated by disaggregating the pedestrian exposure proxies by purpose. Three random-parameter negative binomial regression models were developed to compare the performances of the three pedestrian exposure proxies. It was found that the model in which walking frequency was used as the exposure proxy provided the best goodness-of-fit. Frequency of walking back home, among other trip purposes, was the most sensitive to the increase in pedestrian crash risk. Additionally, increase in the frequency of pedestrian crash was correlated to the increases in the proportions of children and elderly people. Furthermore, household size, median household income, road density, number of non-signalized intersection as well as number of zebra crossings also significantly affected the pedestrian crash frequency. Findings of this study should be indicative to the development and implementation of effective traffic control and management measures that can improve the pedestrian safety in the long run. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming more widespread not only in areas such as smart homes and smart cities but also in research and office environments. The sheer number, heterogeneity, and limited patch availability provide significant challenges for the security of both office networks and the Internet in general. The systematic estimation of device risks, which is essential for mitigation decisions, is currently a skill-intensive task that requires expertise in network vulnerability scanning, as well as manual effort in firmware binary analysis.This article introduces SAFER,1 the Security Assessment Framework for Embedded-device Risks, which enables a semi-automated risk assessment of IoT devices in any network. SAFER combines information from network device identification and automated firmware analysis to estimate the current risk associated with the device. Based on past vulnerability data and vendor patch intervals for device models, SAFER extrapolates those observations into the future using different automatically parameterized prediction models. Based on that, SAFER also estimates an indicator for future security risks. This enables users to be aware of devices exposing high risks in the future.One major strength of SAFER over other approaches is its scalability, achieved through significant automation. To demonstrate this strength, we apply SAFER in the network of a large multinational organization, to systematically assess the security level of hundreds of IoT devices on large-scale networks.Results indicate that SAFER successfully identified 531 out of 572 devices leading to a device identification rate of 92.83 %, analyzed 825 firmware images, and predicted the current and future security risk for 240 devices.},

However, while most studies examine these tools in isolation, researchers have come to recognize that assessing their impact requires understanding the behavior of their human interactants. In this paper, building off of several recent crowdsourcing works focused on criminal justice, we conduct a vignette study in which laypersons are tasked with predicting future re-arrests. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Participants often predict that an offender will be rearrested even when they deem the likelihood of re-arrest to be well below 50%; (2) Participants do not anchor on the RAI's predictions; (3) The time spent on the survey varies widely across participants and most cases are assessed in less than 10 seconds; (4) Judicial decisions, unlike participants' predictions, depend in part on factors that are orthogonal to the likelihood of re-arrest. These results highlight the influence of several crucial but often overlooked design decisions and concerns around generalizability when constructing crowdsourcing studies to analyze the impacts of RAI},

Application of Digital Human Modeling (DHM) is a pathway for proactive ergonomics. However, DHM has the issue of fidelity and it is yet not in the level of simulating human perceptions and emotions accurately. In this study, we have proposed an ergonomics approach that is used to infuse human factor engineering (HFE) guidelines during the early design process. The approach utilizes Virtual Reality (VR), Computer Aided Design (CAD) objects, and human-subjects to proactively filter design ideas, during the conceptualization phase, before functional prototypes are built. A comparative study between full computational prototyping and mixed prototype using VR is performed by (a) designing cockpit packaging and (b) assessing human performance during a fire in cockpit emergency situation. It is found that the cockpit design based on the two prototyping strategies provide similar outcomes. However, the computational prototyping approach is more suitable in design space exploration and the mixed prototyping is more relevant for communicating design ideas.

The general description of the system logic and architecture introduces the core of the solution, the Trust Assessment System. A 'black box' based on risk analysis and advanced machine learning algorithms aimed to assign a Traveller Trust Score to each single individual intentioned to cross the border. Main benefits are: Improved checkpoint throughput, improved situational awareness and level of security, better traveller experience, optimisation of resources. The concept is that the traveller risk evaluation starts as soon as she/he applies for a visa, a passport or books a trip by whatever means of transport. {\textcopyright} 2018 IST-Africa Institute.},

abstract = {Maintaining taxi safety is one of the important goals of operating urban transportation systems. Taxicabs are often prone to higher crash risk due to their long-time exposure to the complicated and dynamic traffic environments in urban areas. Despite existing efforts in understanding the safety issues associated with these vehicles, there were still few attempts that have specifically examined the relationship between taxi-involved crashes and other multifaceted contributing factors. To this end, this paper aims to develop crash frequency models for analyzing taxi-involved crashes. In particular, the spatial autocorrelations between variables were explored and the Poisson conditional autoregressive (Poisson-CAR) models for taxi-involved crashes were proposed. Unlike previous safety studies that mainly consider distance as the key indicator of spatial correlation, the present paper introduced the use of massive taxi trip data for constructing a more informative spatial weight matrix. The developed models with the taxi trip-based weight matrix were tested by using the 2016 taxi trip data collected in Washington D.C. The modeling results highlight the key explanatory factors such as road density, taxi activity, number of bus stops, and land use. More importantly, it demonstrates that the proposed Poisson-CAR models with the taxi trip-based weight matrix outperformed both the non-spatial Poisson model and the Poisson-CAR models using conventional distance-based weight matrix. Moran's I tests further indicate that our proposed models have sufficiently accounted for the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. Thus, it deserves to consider informative spatial weight matrices when applying spatial models in traffic safety studies. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Many system safety analysis (SSA) methods focus only on individual physical component failure. Some human reliability analyses (HRA) consider human-machine or human-automation interaction (HAI) in determining system failure rates; however, very few SSA methods account for interaction of components in hazard exposure. There is no SSA technique that provides the capability to quantify the impact of human/automation reliability on hazard exposure risk. The objectives of this study were to enhance the system hazard analysis (SHA) technique by introducing the concept of hazard risk bands and human/automation reliability classification using fuzzy sets, and to formulate a new risk-reliability score in a three-dimensional analysis space. Fuzzy sets are applicable in the systems safety domain as the classification of risk probability and severity are based on linguistic rather than numerical variables. The enhanced SHA technique yields a revised final mishap risk index, which is projected based on a composite assessment of HAI reliability at the time of system operation. The revised technique also supports broader control recommendations. The enhanced method was compared with human factors process failure modes and effects analysis (HF-PFMEA), which was considered to be the most similar HRA technique. The enhanced SHA approach provides comparable, if not more detailed, results. {\textcopyright} 2016 Proceedings of the 2016 Industrial and Systems Engineering Research Conference, ISERC 2016.

abstract = {With ever-greater reliance of the developed world on information and communication technologies, constructing secure software has become a top priority. To produce secure software, security activities need to be integrated throughout the software development lifecycle. One such activity is security design analysis (SDA), which identifies security requirements as early as the software design phase. While considered an important step in software development, the general opinion of information security subject matter experts and researchers is that SDA is challenging to learn and teach. Experimental evidence provided in literature confirms this claim. To help solve this, we have developed a framework for teaching SDA by utilizing case study analysis and the hybrid flipped classroom approach. We evaluate our framework by performing a comparative analysis between a group of students who attended labs generated using our framework and a group that participated in traditional labs. Our results show that labs created using our framework achieve better learning outcomes for SDA, as opposed to the traditional labs. Secondary contributions of our article include teaching materials, such as lab descriptions and a case study of a hospital information system to be used for SDA. We outline instructions for using our framework in different contexts, including university courses and corporate training programs. By using our proposed teaching framework, with our or any other case study, we believe that both students and employees can learn the craft of SDA more effectively.},

abstract = {The flight test is a critical step in process of development in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to demonstrate performance and verify innovative technologies and methods applied to the system. According to experience and statistic data, human error is becoming one of primary causes of incidents/accidents in UAS operations, but there is less comments about human factor in UAS flight test. However, one significant objective for test is to ensure success of test and safety of testing vehicle, ground people and ground asset within testing range. For this reason, analyzing human factor is an effective way to avoid human errors leading to accidents or catastrophes in testing. In this paper, the characteristics of UAS flight testing, which includes special testing environment, high level of automation, less human intervention, high risk and difficulties of testing due to new integrated system and complex data processing and so on, were presented at first in order to identify human factor issues involved in testing. Then, reviews of UAS incident and accident caused by operator error were described. Moreover, in order to analyze effects of human factor in testing, typical UAS mission were designed and conducted in both experimental unmanned vehicle and ground simulator. Through experimental and results analysis, several key human factor issues affecting flight testing were discussed, such as workload, confusion, situation awareness, teaming, human-machine relationship, etc. while all of these factors may lead to unsafe operation during testing. Although the main roles of UAS test operator/pilot are supervising the status of systems and handling emergency situations, human crew still have a significant effect on testing. Operator and automatic system is forming a partnership during operation. To enhance the safety of testing and improve crew performance, especially to minimize possibility of incorrect operation, suggestions are proposed on the above analysis, which can be used in UAS flight testing, operator selection and improvement of control station design. On the other hand, studying of human factor in flight testing can provide an effective guidance and mitigation to avoid human errors both in civil and military UAS operation. {\textcopyright} 31st Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences, ICAS 2018.

If these datasets could be published, then they would be valuable assets to various service providers to explore business opportunities, to study commuter behavior for better transport management, which in turn benefits the general public for day-to-day commuting. However, there are two major concerns that considerably limit the availability and the usage of these trajectory datasets. The first is the threat to individual privacy, as users' trajectories may be misused to discover sensitive information, such as home locations, their children's school locations, or social information like habits or relationships. The other concern is the ability to analyze the exabytes of location data in a timely manner. Although there have been trajectory anonymization approaches proposed in the past to mitigate privacy concerns. None of these prior works address the scalability issue, since it is a newly occurring problem brought by the significantly increasing adoption of location-based services. In this article, we conquer these two challenges by designing a novel parallel trajectory anonymization algorithm that achieves scalability, strong privacy protection, and high utility rate of the anonymized trajectory datasets. We have conducted extensive experiments using MapReduce and Spark on real maps with different topologies, and our results prove both effectiveness and efficiency when compared with the centralized approaches.},

abstract = {Emergency management in industrial plants is a fundamental issue to ensure the safety of operators. The emergency management analyses two fundamental aspects: the system reliability and the human reliability. System reliability is the capability of ensuring the functional properties within a variability of work conditions, considering the possible deviations due to unexpected events. However, system reliability is strongly related to the reliability of its weakest component. The complexity of the processes could generate incidental situations and the worker appears (human reliability) to be the weakest part of the whole system. The complexity of systems influences operator's ability to take decisions during emergencies. The aim of the present research is to develop a new approach to evaluate human error probability (HEP), called Systematic Human Reliability Analysis (SHRA). The proposed approach considers internal and external factors that affect operator's ability. The new approach is based on Nuclear Action Reliability Assessment (NARA), Simplified Plant Analysis Risk Human Reliability (SPAR-H) and on the Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) relationship. The present paper analysed some shortcomings related to literature approaches, especially the limitations of the working time. We estimated HEP, after 8 hours (work standard) during emergency conditions. The correlations between the advantages of these three methodologies allows proposing a HEP analysis during accident scenarios emergencies. SHRA can be used to estimate human reliability during emergencies. SHRA has been applied in a nuclear accident scenario, considering 24 hours of working time. The SHRA results highlight the most important internal and external factors that affect operator's ability. {\textcopyright} 2020},

abstract = {According to many statistics it is widely accepted that human errors contribute to between 70%-80% of related aviation accidents. Aircraft maintenance errors make up a percentage of between 7 to 15% of that, as of which it is also generally accepted that they are at even larger extent the cause of safety occurrences, i.e. events which did not escalate into an incident or accident. Accidents resulted from maintenance errors not only will undermine the viability of the industry but will also represent a major cost for airlines. It is clear from previous research that this is an issue for aviation industry and in order to further reduce the maintenance events, some radical changes would need to take place, including both proactive and predictive methods. Human errors problem is described in detail from historical, theoretical and practical aspects. Concluding that human errors will always occur, a proposal for a numerical predictive approach to manage the maintenance error is made. This paper presents a maintenance human error quantification approach which can be used as a predictive tool in assessing risks in aircraft maintenance operations. The proposed method is based on expressing the human error probability as a function of factors which affect the maintenance performance: task, individual, environment and system. An example is used to demonstrate feasibility. A discussion on limitation of the method is also made. The most important factor limiting the reliability of the method is the lack of human error rate data. Recommendations are made for collecting such data through observations, programmed trials, surveys, reporting methods and even expert judgment. Finally, conclusions are drawn. This Paper highlights the possibility of making predictions on human errors in aircraft maintenance, considering the contributing factors to these errors and raising awareness on eliminating them or diminishing their influence. It can also offer cost benefits on day to day maintenance operations by better planning of safety critical tasks and avoiding delays due to maintenance errors. {\textcopyright} 2019 Israel Annual Conference on Aerospace Sciences.

In order to fully understand the maintenance errors and contributing factors, this paper investigated a sample of 3,783 Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) incident reports submitted in the period of January 1st 2008 to December 31st 2008, which are formed by maintenance personnel or non-maintenance personnel. The Maintenance Error Decision Aid (MEDA) and Correspondence Analysis (CA) methods are used to analysis maintenance error, its contributing factors and the relationship between them. The result shows both maintenance personnel and nonmaintenance personnel considered human error accounts for a large proportion of maintenance error, and individual-related factors and management-related factors are the most frequent reasons for maintenance error. The outcomes also indicate that non-maintenance perspective should not be ignored because it can provide abundant information which is not included in maintenance personnel reports and helpful to reduce error. Meanwhile, the management-related factors are as crucial as individual-related factors, which should be paid more attention. {\textcopyright} 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Due to such an increase, required cybersecurity precautions against all kinds of cyber-attacks and cyber-threats should be taken by both organizations and individuals. This study aims to develop a reliable and valid measurement tool to measure cybercrime awareness levels of individuals. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a scale named as Cybercrime Awareness Scale (CAS) has been developed and psychometric properties of the scale have been tested by two separate studies. Findings: The first study included a total of 500 respondents (294 female and 206 male). In the first study, factor structure of the proposed scale has been determined through an exploratory factor analysis. The results revealed a three-factor structure (i.e. information systems crimes, personal data crimes, and privacy and security). Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients for the subdimensions were 0.95, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively. The sample of the second study consisted of 494 respondents (281 female and 213 male). The confirmatory-factor-analysis results revealed that three-factor structure is valid and optimal model. Further, the proposed scale demonstrated moderate concurrent validity results in relation to the Digital Data Security Awareness Scale. Originality/value: Findings indicated that the CAS is a valid and reliable measurement tool to measure individuals' cybercrime awareness level. This study makes a novel contribution to the existing cybersecurity literature by providing the CAS, which is developed by following rigorous methodological standards.

abstract = {In the past decade, a new class of cyber-threats, known as "Advanced Persistent Threat"(APT), has emerged and has been used by different organizations to perform dangerous and effective attacks against financial and politic entities, critical infrastructures, and so on. To identify APT related malware early, a semi-automatic approach for malware samples analysis is needed. Recently, a malware triage step for a semi-automatic malware analysis architecture has been introduced. This step identifies incoming APT samples early, among all the malware delivered per day in the cyber-space, to immediately dispatch them to deeper analysis. In the article, the authors have built the knowledge base on known APTs obtained from publicly available reports. For efficiency reasons, they rely on static malware features, extracted with negligible delay, and use machine learning techniques for the identification. Unfortunately, the proposed solution has the disadvantage of requiring a long training time and needs to be completely retrained each time new APT samples or even a new APT class are discovered. In this article, we move from multi-class classification to a group of one-class classifiers, which significantly decreases runtime and allows higher modularity, while still guaranteeing precision and accuracy over 90%.},

abstract = {Cybercrime reports showed an increase in the number of attacks targeting financial institutions. Indeed, banks were the target of 30% of the total number of cyber-attacks. One of the recommended methods for driving the security challenges is to implement an Information Security Governance Framework (ISGF), a comprehensive practice that starts from the top management and ends with the smallest function in a bank. Although such initiatives are effective, they typically take years to achieve and require loads of resources, especially for larger banks or if there are multiple ISGFs available for the bank to choose. These implementation challenges showed the necessity of having a method for evaluating the adequacy of an ISGF for a bank. The research performed during the preparation of this article did not reveal any available structured evaluation method for an ISGF before its implementation. This chapter introduces a novel method for scoring an ISGF to assess its adequacy for a bank without implementing it. The suggested approach is based on ISGF decomposition and transformation into a survey that will be answered by security experts. The survey results were loaded into a Deep Learning Algorithm that produced a scoring model that could predict the adequacy of an ISGF for a bank with an accuracy of 75%.},

abstract = {The performance of face analysis and recognition systems depends on the quality of the acquired face data, which is influenced by numerous factors. Automatically assessing the quality of face data in terms of biometric utility can thus be useful to detect low-quality data and make decisions accordingly. This survey provides an overview of the face image quality assessment literature, which predominantly focuses on visible wavelength face image input. A trend towards deep learning-based methods is observed, including notable conceptual differences among the recent approaches, such as the integration of quality assessment into face recognition models. Besides image selection, face image quality assessment can also be used in a variety of other application scenarios, which are discussed herein. Open issues and challenges are pointed out, i.a., highlighting the importance of comparability for algorithm evaluations and the challenge for future work to create deep learning approaches that are interpretable in addition to providing accurate utility predictions.},
